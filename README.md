Thirsty Sword Lesbians content module for FoundryVTT
This is the unofficial Thirsty Sword Lesbians content module for asacolips' Powered by the Apocalypse system! This module includes all the moves, playbook information, worldbuliding and safety tools, and character sheet templates from the text of Thirsty Sword Lesbians, made available under the CC BY SA 4.0 license.



This is not a complete content pack, however. I recommend you download the free VTT assets pack from https://www.evilhat.com/home/thirsty-sword-lesbians-resources/, which is free for individual use but not distribution. This contains tokens, a splash screen, and a string tracking sheet.
