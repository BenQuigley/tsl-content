# tsl-content
Thank you for downloading the unofficial Thirsty Sword Lesbians content module for asacolips' Powered by the Apocalypse system! This module includes all the moves, playbook information, and character sheet templates from the text of Thirsty Sword Lesbians.

 

**How to Use This Module**
1. Open the "Tools and Resources" compendium in your Compendiums tab

2. Open the "PbtA Sheet Configuration" journal entry and copy the contents to your clipboard

3. Go to Settings and click "PbtA Sheet Configuration"

4. Paste the contents into the text area and click "Save Configuration"

**Note: The above must be done before you import any character sheets.**

5. Import your desired character sheets and their playbooks from the "Character Sheets" and "Playbooks" compendiums. Imported playbooks are stored in your Items tab

6. Open the Playbook for your character sheet and set your sheet's stats and other information according to the playbook

7. When you advance, import moves from the relevant compendiums.

8. For custom classes, create a new Actor using the "character" type.

 

This does not yet include the premade settings or virtual tabletop assets such as the string tracker. I recommend you download the free VTT assets pack from https://www.evilhat.com/home/thirsty-sword-lesbians-resources/, which is free for individual use but not distribution. This contains tokens, a splash screen, and a string tracking sheet.
