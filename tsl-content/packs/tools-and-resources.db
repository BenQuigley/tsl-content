Oppose the Empire and seek out community on a galactic scale. Starcross Galaxy is a space opera that reimagines pulp sci-fi to celebrate queer love and power!</p><h2>Principles</h2><h3>Make Space Weird and Magical</h3><p>Hop into your space whale with your chosen family and investigate a magic vortex to another realm. Cross swords with the Legion on galactic livestream when they raid your underground talk show. Fall in love with a gay spaceship. One motif of Starcross is putting a familiar situation into a completely alien context, and exploring how that context inspires you to imagine new possibilities.</p><h3>Explore, Learn, and Share</h3><p>Space is vast and full of possibility. Connect with your community or pine longingly across the parsecs. Meet people who live in a way you never imagined and wonder why you do things the way you do, if it’s habit or intention that structures your life.</p><h3>Focus on People</h3><p>Thirsty Sword Lesbians shines when used to tell stories centered on people—people you can talk to, flirt with, try to understand, and duel. One side of this is being generous with information; there are no mechanics for how well you can scan a space anomaly and understand the physics or magic behind it. The GM should just tell you some interesting or actionable information about it. The other side is to get people involved. Maybe the space anomaly heralds a confused time-traveler who has been in so many continuities they can’t keep them straight. Or maybe a scientist is deeply invested in getting credit for the discovery, or the Legion wants to harness it against a nearby world.</p><h2>Setting</h2><p><strong>The Haven Cooperative</strong> is a union of seven star systems with dozens of species and hundreds of cultures. They’re united by a shared commitment to cooperation and mutual learning. The Haven can serve as the PCs’ home community, or you can define a smaller community within the Haven— especially if you’re interested in exploring conflict within this utopian realm.</p><p>The antithesis of the Haven is the <strong>Void Legion</strong>, an authoritarian and exploitative power that desires domination over the galaxy. The Empress is popular in the Imperial Core, and she uses the might of her Legion and the sophistication of her propagandists to expand and consolidate her power.</p><p><strong>Independent star systems</strong> dot the galaxy, bound together through a patchwork of faster-than-light travel techniques. The wormhole network connects far-flung systems on opposite sides of the galaxy, while networks of ether streams provide more local travel. In between the stars known to the Haven are vast swaths of the galaxy that can’t yet be reached. Some ancient lightspeed signals have emerged from nearby, unreachable stars, but any conversation would take thousands of years.</p><p>But wormholes can be fickle, and ether streams are countless. Explorers who brave uncharted routes can find awe-inspiring wonders of nature and meet new civilizations, and explorers from elsewhere arrive from time to time. If they’re lucky, they don’t arrive in the <strong>Void Empress’s</strong> territory.</p><h2>Campaigns</h2><h3>Agents of the Gay Agenda</h3><p>The PCs are agents from across the Haven who operate in Void Legion space and on independent worlds, supporting local factions working towards liberation and trying to thwart the Void Legion’s schemes.</p><h4><strong>Adventure Ideas:</strong></h4><ul><li><p>Rebel catfolk in occupied territory are in urgent need of resupply. Can the PCs sneak, con, and flirt their way through Void Legion space with a cargo ship and keep the feline freedom fighters from failing? Can they get a shipful of refugees back out?</p></li><li><p>During a visit to an independent system, a Haven-friendly activist intro- duces the PCs to a friend who has been questioning their gender and wants to talk about it with people who will understand and aren’t part of their local circles. Meanwhile, a magic sword is stolen from the museum where they work, a relic that would be extraordinarily dangerous in the wrong hands. Can the PCs support their new friend while also retrieving the relic?</p></li><li><p>The Void Legion’s new blockbuster film is about to premiere, and the actors are traveling to an independent world as part of a tour to wine and dine local influencers. The PCs’ mission is to discredit the Void Legion’s propaganda and disrupt their influence.</p></li></ul><h3>Seeking Connection</h3><p>The PCs explore rogue wormholes and dangerous ether currents, and wind up exploring their own relationships and emotions as much as they explore outer space.</p><p><strong>Adventure Ideas:</strong></p><ul><li><p>The PCs arrive at a star system full of four-armed green cuties and mostly just have a nice time getting to know them. Miscommunications and conflicting feelings spice up the visit and someone might get challenged to a duel, but the scale is interpersonal and intimate. Use the emotional conflicts from the PCs’ playbooks as inspiration, and introduce them to green cuties who are struggling with the same issues they are.</p></li><li><p>A rogue wormhole drops the PCs into a new star system, then collapses behind them. The people of this star system are initially wary or even hostile, because it just so happens that a Void Legion scout force has recently been raiding the system, and has abducted a number of people. The silver lining is that this means there’s probably another path back to known space.</p></li><li><p>A giant space beetle has appeared in contested space and seems to be trying to communicate. As first contact experts, the PCs are called in to try to befriend the new arrival. Of course, they’re not the only ones with an interest in the visitor, and the way they handle conflict with the other interested parties will surely shape the beetle’s perception of them and of the Haven.</p></li></ul><h2>Characters</h2><h3>Haven</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Mediator Karikcha (ze/zir):</strong> A Mantid who studied with the empathic Dryads of Rhond. Ze is an influential figure in the Hive movement, whose vision for the Haven is modeled on the eusocial behavior of space bees. Ze has a taste for sweets and is always looking for an excuse to bake and share zir treats, but the sword on zir belt isn’t just for show. A Dryad lover gave zir a gift: one of the Dryad’s many arms, which provided the wood for the sword’s frame. It’s edged in red laser, the color of her leaves.</p><p>Does zir vision for the Haven match with the PCs’ Will ze be a friend, an enemy, or both?</p></li><li><p><strong>Tentacula Stronktopus Bloodsea (she/her):</strong> A former champion of the Legion, a muscular octopus woman with blue skin and ruddy, vampiric tentacles for hair. When the Legion arrived at her world, they came as friends, there to share technology and protect them against a terrible threat from the depths of space. Tenta’s family made a pact with the Legion, and when some on her world rebelled, she fought as a Legion general. Now she sees that she bought into a lie, that the family she trusted had sold out their world, and that the people she hurt were right all along. She’s too ashamed to return home, but she helps the people of the Haven and the independent systems resist the Legion with her knowledge and her Legion-tech sword.</p><p>When the PCs need help navigating Void Legion territory, can she move past her shame and face her past? When victims of the Void Empress vent their hurt on Tentacula, how do the PCs respond?</p></li></ul><h3>Independent</h3><p><strong>Her Divine Radiance, Eliavarradrine of Crystalia (she/her; gender: opal):</strong> A religious figure and talk show host from the holy world of Crystalia. Crystalia is said to be the birthplace of the sheltering darkness and the nurturing light, and the reverence of these extremes is the foundation of a common faith on many worlds. For generations, Crystalia held a reputation for moral courage and authority, but it was silent on the villainy of the Void Legion. Elia recently denounced her own world government for this silence, and has begun publishing evidence of Legion atrocities, evidence that had been sent to Crystalia by those begging for aid and support in surviving the Legion’s expansion. She has no sword, only the crystalline regalia of her station as one chosen by Radiance.</p><p>Does she invite the PCs onto her show to interview them or for them to debate someone else? Do the PCs see the toll her rebellion has taken on her and offer support?</p><p><strong>Zephyr Celeste, Autonomous Spaceship (she/her):</strong> Zephyr Celeste was built by the Void Legion, an experiment in a new tier of artificial intelligence, one sophisticated enough to control the doomsday weapon they built into her. Fortunately for the rest of the galaxy, they were unable to control their creation, and she has just escaped them. She’s programmed herself never to kill again, and is trying to find a way to make the galaxy better. She’s also very interested in conversations about identity; in particular, she has been questioning the gender she was assigned at berth.</p><p>Was Zephyr’s devastating weapon ever used before she broke free? With people demanding that she be destroyed, with the Legion hunting her, what would the PCs advise?</p><p><strong>Tarxie (de/der):</strong> A Dragon sex worker and information broker with contacts on a dozen worlds. De only accepts payment for sex work in secrets, but der information can be had in trade. De is a wingless blue Dragon, about eight feet tall with a long, serpentine torso and a thick tail. Der sword is nimble and envenomed, but it’s rare that de needs to draw it given der stature and wide range of friends.</p><p>When the PCs need intel, what price does Tarxie ask? When word gets out that they know a juicy secret, how long before Tarxie comes to make them an enticing offer?</p><h3>Legion</h3><p><strong>Countess Mordrella Fang (she/her/milady):</strong> A pale Imperial noblewoman, muscled and scarred. Despite her military prowess, she is most renowned for her extravagant parties, typi- cally taking place at unique locations such as the Titans’ Graveyard or the Whispering Nebula. These gatherings are where deals are made that reshape alliances on a galactic scale and where scandals unfold to destroy her rivals. In jarring contrast to her elegant and elaborate jackets and gowns, Fang’s sword is a jagged blade of bone, white with a reddish tinge. She stole the sword from deep within ancient ruins during the “pacification” of a border world early in her military career, and she refuses to part with it.</p><p>If the PCs can prove that she’s a literal vampire, would that harm her social standing? Can they attend one of her parties and beat her at her own game?</p><p><strong>Captain Denise Bycross (she/her)</strong>: Captain Bycross commands the ISS Insatiable, part of the Imperial Void Legion Expeditionary Force. Her continuing mission is to seek out new life and new civilizations and conquer them in the name of the Empire. Lanky and quick, with short blonde hair, Captain Bycross is deadly with her immaculately maintained, top-of-the- line Legion laserblade. Per standard Void Legion practice, she doesn’t simply blast enemy starships with her energy cannons. Rather, she leads the boarding party to face the enemy hand-to-hand and take their ship intact. Her career has stagnated, however, because she refuses to wed any of the male admirals. Rumor has it that one of them even began an inves- tigation into her fitness to command, under suspicion of “sympathizing with subversives.”</p><p>Just how sympathetic can the subversives persuade her to be? Does she have qualms about what she’s done? Does she beat them to a new discovery and show up when the PCs least expect it?</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Names vary widely in the Starcross Galaxy and include sounds never intended for human lips, not to mention names encoded in motion, scent, color, and mathematics. Give the Imperials dreary or ominous names, and give the Haven vibrant and varied ones. Celebrate the full range of possibility, especially when the PCs encounter an unfamiliar culture with a different way of communicating.</p><h2>Custom Rules</h2><h3>Get Creative With Pronouns</h3><p>Choose pronouns suitable for your playbook. Beast pronouns. Devoted pronouns. Trickster pronouns. There are no wrong answers, only permission to get original.</p><h3>Techno Witch</h3><p>You can use the Nature Witch playbook to play a character who is in tune with technological environments, either instead of or in addition to natural ones. Use the Techno Witch variant described on page 67.</p><h3>Custom Move - Cross Vast Distances</h3><p>When you undertake a journey across the stars, resolve these prompts in the order that you pass through the regions described. The PCs resolve these as a group, not individually.</p><p>If any part of your journey is within…</p><p>...the Haven Cooperative, name a friendly person and describe their area of expertise. They will say hello and give you useful information, an opportunity, or a shoulder to cry on.</p><p>...Independent Space, roll +The number of friends you can name who live near your route (max +3):</p><p>10+: You’re invited to partake in a delightful or useful local social function.</p><p>7–9: You’re asked to fulfill an obligation under local customs.

In the end, are you glad you participated?</p><p>6–: The GM is encouraged to make a move that emphasizes the PCs’ alienation from the local culture, consequences of their previous adventures in the region, or the growing influence of the Void Legion.</p><p>...Void Legion Space, roll +Nothing (+1 if you have the help of someone who has spent years here):</p><p></p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":300000,"name":"Lesbeans Coffeehouse","type":"text","_id":"2IjxeFis6xGcQf53","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>By Dominique Dicke</p><h1>Overview</h1><p>In a coffee shop on the border between two worlds, sword lesbians sip hot beverages, fight gentrification, and guard the precious Foxhole Woods from deadly cishet incursions. Lesbeans Coffeehouse balances high fantasy sensibility with stories set in the metropolis of your choice, with a focus on celebrating the magic of cozy queer love.</p><h1>Principles</h1><h2>Find Magic Everywhere</h2><p>The PCs are changed by the queer magical energy of the Foxhole Woods—an energy that they bring with them into all of their interactions. Maybe the magic is visible, a haze of glitter at the edge of your vision. Maybe the magic has a smell, the aroma of the pine forest perme- ating into the city. Maybe the magic is edible, in Lesbeans Coffehouse’s perfectly brewed drinks. Look for oppor- tunities to inject magic into unlikely scenarios, as a mundane world is touched by a fantastical one.</p><h2>Protect Queer Havens</h2><p>Lesbeans Coffeehouse and the Foxhole Woods are both queer havens in danger of falling into cishet hands. These spaces are vital to the communities that they serve, and to lose them would be devastating. Protecting Lesbeans from gentrification and the Foxhole Woods from cishet incursions may entail battle with your words, your swords, or your hearts.</p><h1>Setting</h1><p><strong>Lesbeans Coffeehouse</strong> is a coffee shop on the border of two worlds: an existing metropolis of the GM’s choice, and the utopian <strong>Foxhole Woods</strong>. The Foxhole Woods or the metropolis can be the players’ home community; players can be baristas and co-owners of Lesbeans, or customers with an emotional stake in the business’s success.</p><p>In the Foxhole Woods, the very air is laden with magic. This magic reveals queer people as their true selves, in all their beautiful glory. Crossing the threshold from Lesbeans to the woods entails a magical-girl-style transformation into the most badass and sparkly version of yourself. The Foxhole Woods are governed by the wise <strong>Queen Eustace</strong>, a bachelorette looking for a match, and her teenage daughter Arabella. Eustace and Arabella live in a castle built into a large pine tree, overlooking the Woods.</p><p>Locations in the Foxhole Woods include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Kelley Falls</strong>, a chain of waterfalls where the fertile ground grows many enchanted plants</p></li><li><p><strong>Mariella’s Tavern</strong>, an alehouse where wicked adventures begin</p></li><li><p><strong>The dueling cave</strong>, an underground cavern where official conflicts are resolved through combat</p></li></ul><p>Lesbeans has drawn an unusual number of cishet customers recently, due to rumors spreading throughout town of the drinks’ magical effects. Although business is booming, land developer Mabel York has her eye on the property, with the full backing of the (mostly white) City Council.</p><p>In the mundane world, people in power follow rumors of magical places, seeking to exploit the magic; your average citizen is unaware of this conflict, and perhaps unaware of the existence of magic altogether.</p><p>In the real world, gentrification is a racialized process, in which people of color are priced out of areas that have historically belonged to them.</p><p>Exploring the racial dimensions of gentrification at your own gaming table is optional; if you choose to do so, pay attention to how you assign racial descriptors to NPCs such as Mabel York and the members of City Council. Will Lesbeans Coffeehouse be priced out of their property? Will cishet customers discover the entrance to the Foxhole Woods? Will Queen Eustace find true love? Play to find out!</p><h1>Campaigns</h1><h2>Protecting the Foxhole Woods</h2><p>The PCs are natives of the Foxhole Woods, crossing back and forth between the magical and mundane worlds at will. The door between the worlds is in danger of discovery by denizens of the metropolis, and the PCs have been tasked with keeping the magic of the Foxhole Woods from becoming known to cishets.</p><p><strong>Adventure Ideas:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Princess Arabella has made an illicit outing into the mundane world to rendezvous with her secret crush. Can you find her and return her home, without wrecking her budding romance? Can you prevent her from spilling the truth about the Foxhole Woods to the wrong parties?</p></li><li><p>Queen Eustace has tasked you with developing a new magical drink that convinces cishets that there is nothing extraordinary about Lesbeans Coffeehouse. Inventing such a drink requires ingredients from throughout the Foxhole Woods, as well as a few special flavors from the mundane world. Can you find all the necessary ingredients before nosy cishets find their way into the Foxhole Woods?</p></li><li><p>The members of City Council have discovered the Foxhole Woods, and want to harness the magic to use towards their own political ends. Can you prevent them from harming the Foxhole Woods through a combi- nation of flirtation, negotiation, and sword-wielding?</p></li></ul><h2>Barista Babes</h2><p>The PCs are baristas at the collectively-owned Lesbeans Coffeehouse, and may be natives of the metropolis or of the Foxhole Woods. After hours, the PCs are responsible for hosting a series of meetups for the local queer community. Their speed-dating events are always a hit, though they rarely go according to plan.</p><p>Adventure Ideas:</p><ul><li><p>Queen Eustace plans to venture into the mundane world to try her hand at finding love. She’s been unlucky in love before, and has a series of specifications that her new partner must meet. Can the PCs set her up with her perfect bride?</p></li><li><p>The cishets are crashing your speed-dating night, determined to enjoy the magical beverages of Lesbeans and fall in heterosexual love with each other. Can you show them enough magic to awaken any latent queer- ness in them, without fully revealing the secrets of the Foxhole Woods?</p></li><li><p>Real estate developer Mabel York has gotten wind of the magic behind Lesbeans Coffeehouse, and is working towards buying the property, which would endanger the door between the worlds. Can you convince her to back off before the sale is made?</p></li></ul><h1>Characters</h1><h2>The Foxhole Woods</h2><p><strong>Queen Eustace (she/her):</strong> The wise, steadfast (and single!) ruler of the Foxhole Woods. She leads her domain from a modest castle built inside a large pine tree. She’s not easily flustered and is notoriously difficult to flirt with—past romances have left her particular about who she trusts with her wit and with her heart, though she’s ready to seek love again. Her top priorities are protecting the Foxhole Woods and keeping her daughter safe. Although she may be queen, she’s not above fighting her own battles, with her words or with her broadsword. If she counts on you with her domain or her daughter, you’d better not let her down.</p><p><strong>Princess Arabella (she/her):</strong> Queen Eustace’s teenage daughter, and a budding protector of the Foxhole Woods. She’s perhaps even pickier than her mother, and anyone who seeks to romance the queen must meet Arabella’s approval. Arabella is fiercely curious about the mundane world beyond the Foxhole Woods; although she’s forbidden from visiting the metropolis, she frequently sneaks out to seek romantic adventures of her own.</p><p><strong>Carter (she/her):</strong> Queen Eustace’s bodyguard. She would do anything to further her queen’s interests, whether that means fighting invading cishets with her quarterstaff or serving as a wingwoman. She tries to keep her relationship with Queen Eustace purely professional, but can’t hide her crush on the magnetic monarch.</p><h2>The Metropolis</h2><p><strong>Mabel York (she/her):</strong> A real estate developer in the metropolis with her eye on Lesbeans Coffeehouse as her next converted property. She’s known for buying up local businesses and turning the properties into a string of identical apartment buildings, with rent far too expensive for any resi- dents in the area. She has most of the City Council in her pocket, funding their campaigns in exchange for leniency when it comes to zoning laws. Although she enjoys the drinks at Lesbeans, she would be even happier turning the block into an upscale apartment building than she is sitting in the window booth sipping a cappuccino.</p><p><strong>Brandy Ryan (she/her):</strong> The City Council president. She has a big gay crush on Mabel York, but probably doesn’t know she’s queer yet. She loves the vibe at Lesbeans Coffeehouse and generally feels accepted in the space, but totally supports Mabel’s agenda to buy the property. If she could witness the queer magic of the Foxhole Woods, something might awaken within her...</p><p><strong>Chloe Davila (they/them):</strong> Princess Arabella’s secret love interest. A freshman at the nearby university, they frequent Lesbeans Coffeehouse for marathon caffeine-fueled study sessions. They know that Arabella’s mother would never approve of them as a match for the princess and are content to keep their love under wraps, confined to surreptitious dates at Lesbeans Coffeehouse.</p><h1>Names</h1><h2>The Foxhole Woods</h2><ul><li><p>Allia</p></li><li><p>Celia</p></li><li><p>Lyna</p></li><li><p>Marguerite</p></li><li><p>Winnifred</p></li></ul><h2>The Metropolis</h2><ul><li><p>Anita Erikson</p></li><li><p>Georgina Kramer</p></li><li><p>Gertrude Nunez</p></li><li><p>Kathy Poole</p></li><li><p>Violet Hodge</p></li><li><p>Custom Rules</p></li></ul><h1>Magical Drinks</h1><p>When a PC consumes a drink from Lesbeans Coffeehouse, that player gets to narrate how the magic in that drink impacts them.

In pouring rain, light cycles race through narrow alleys, chasing down fragile hope. Can we honor fallen comrades and tear down the Mega-Corp? Will we free the city from greed and corruption? When avatars are activated and systems of power are hacked, neon swords come to life!</p><h1>Principles</h1><h2>Reveal the Cruelty and Warmth of the City</h2><p>Neon City is dangerous and people are driven to desperation. Illegal street races blend the virtual and the real, obsolete war droids are enslaved by fight clubs. But bustling night markets are full of friendly vendors, and holo- tattoo parlors give you a new face when you’re outrunning the authorities. In Neon City, it’s easy to get in over your head, but it’s just as easy to find a flirty new friend!</p><h2>Bleed Neon and Cool</h2><p>When the acid rain bleeds neon onto the streets, do we find shelter in each other’s arms? When changing your body is only as hard as getting the creds, how do you express your heart and transcend humanity? When your avatar comes to life, how does the augmented world reveal your hidden desires?</p><h2>Build a Revolution on Its People</h2><p>You were radicalized by the cruelty of the Mega-Corp, but you can’t fight with righteous anger alone. A revolution is only as strong as its people, and winning the war will mean winning hearts. Help a struggling neighborhood sabotage the demolition drones that tear down their homes! Infiltrate a corp sector and free an executive who fell in love with you! Start up a hackette haven and build a mech that will pummel the Mega-Corp!</p><h1>Setting</h1><p>Neon City is a megalopolis with buildings that stretch hundreds of stories up. The Mega-Corp openly controls politics, authority, and all forms of power. Each executive owns a sector and has been gifted technology, professionals, and assets to bleed their territory dry. Once a neighborhood is brought to its knees, the Mega-Corp builds over it, restructures itself, and salvages what’s left. It’s brutal, dehumanizing, and merciless.</p><p>The Mega-Corp sees people as commodities. Lives are traded by perceived value, advertisement campaigns program the populace, and propaganda maintains compliance and obscures the truth. The Mega- Corp is a machine that seeks to outlive us all. But we’re here to break that machine—forever.</p><p>On the edges of the city, diverse communities live on what they can scavenge and build together. These communities are thousands of people strong, each with their own factions, cultures, and laws. People navigate social circles with grace and daring, cashing in debts and building networks of favors. The PCs can define a community or agree to come from different ones and build an underground together.</p><p>Life on the fringes is about survival. Light cycle gangs stare down the Mega-Corp to protect their territory and each other. People are wary and resilient, each bearing the trauma inflicted by the Mega-Corp. But people are also loving and full of hope, compassionate when their trust is earned.</p><p>Salvaging and repurposing technology is the heart of the revolution. This could involve transferring a soul into a mechanical body to uncover secrets, helping an AI realize their pop idol dreams, or stealing Mega-Corp augments to rebuild themselves. It could also mean creating the perfect date in virtual reality and charming the cute private detective!</p><p>As oppressive and cruel as the Mega-Corp is, many support and uphold its injustice. They fight for scraps, seek to get ahead, and serve as lackeys. They’re content to perpetuate cycles of use and abuse, and are more dangerous and sinister than those who hold power. But they all hope for something better. Can you get past their fear to reveal the truth of their hearts?</p><h1>Campaigns</h1><h2>Idol Talk</h2><p>The PCs have infiltrated the entertainment complex of the Mega-Corp. AIs are created to spread propaganda by using emotion amplification tech- nology to manipulate the populace. Can the PCs help the AIs discover love and free them of their shackles?</p><h3>Adventure Ideas:</h3><ul><li><p>Sofia Strawberry’s concerts draw in millions. Her digitized likeness is on every advertising board and in every bedroom. Rumors say she’s fallen in love with Isa Canon, a hotshot lightracer forced to run fixed races for the Mega-Corp. Can the PCs bring the two together and help love save them both?</p></li><li><p>It’s the 50th annual battle of the bands, and all of Neon City will tune in. Promising musician-warriors will flood the netscape with music in this month-long competition, and they’re putting everything on the line. Only one band can join the ranks of the few human bands licensed to perform. But at each band elimination, souls are harvested for new Idol AIs that serve the Mega-Corp without question. Can the PCs outper- form and survive, while saving everyone else from such a terrible fate?</p></li><li><p>Cerulean Sky was a digital idol scheduled for reformat. She escaped and was assimilated by an abandoned war rig from the long-ago conflict that created Neon City. Now she devastates the city, singing songs of pain while sowing destruction.

Will their combined spirit summon the Void Sword that will protect the city?</p></li></ul><h2>Runaway Ren</h2><p>The PCs are one of many tasked to plant the seeds of dissent, desire, and revolution. We can birth this revolution if we bring all of Neon City together!</p><h3>Adventure Ideas</h3><ul><li><p>The Mega-Corp will reclaim the edges of the city, and has pledged to pave over those that live beyond corporate rule. Community leaders can’t agree on what to do next, and Reclaimers are on the way. Can the PCs fight back and bring communities together? What can they build to hold back the Mega-Corp?</p></li><li><p>Kora Flyn and her Dancing Devils are the rising stars of Neon City’s dangerous street races. They were Colony-Warriors, but they revolted and claimed the streets for their own. Can the PCs convince them to fight back and recruit other light racers to the cause? Can they impress them with sword fights that take place on a light cycle?</p></li><li><p>The Mega-Corp fears Hostile Corporate Rescues and the disruption to their systems and schedules. When an employee is brave enough to leave behind their life of monochrome servitude, they send out a signal and the PCs answer! The Corp Security is extreme, with strong women and cute AIs manning huge mechs and weapon systems. Can the PCs fight and flirt their way into building a rebellion, one rescue at a time?</p></li></ul><h2>Neon Noir Nights</h2><p>The PCs have set up a detective agency in a sector that never stops raining. They help the disenfranchised and offer “special” services to fight for those who can’t. Can they stay one step ahead of the Mega-Corp lackeys while solving cases and capturing hearts?</p><h3>Adventure Ideas</h3><ul><li><p>A hacker shows up, bloody and bruised, her memory discs wiped clean. One of the PCs barely recognizes her before having their own memory of the relationship wiped in an instant. Who is she and what did she get caught up with?</p></li><li><p>An executive and secret contact calls the agency, her voice desperate and pleading. The holo-call is abruptly cut off.

They were once a detective of the agency but disappeared, chasing down a dangerous case. They say they were murdered but can’t remember who did it and how. They only know that the murderer has stolen a black box full of Mega-Corp secrets.</p></li></ul><h1>Characters</h1><h2>Fringe Communities</h2><p><strong>Quela Canto (she/her):</strong> Quela brought together communities and made them agree to a code of protection and mutual support. She ensures folks are healthy and their augments are cared for. Once the Mega-Corp’s most powerful executive, Quela is as careful with her past as with her heart. Quela dresses in ragged silks that complement her dark complexion and wears honey rain perfume. Her sword is an elegant vibra-blade that sings against the air and cuts steel.</p><p>Will Quela allow the PCs to help her and the communities? Will she stand in the way of the rebellion, choosing safety instead?</p><p><strong>The Fixer (zi/zir):</strong> The Fixer is a mysterious figure who hides zir features behind a huge flashing emoticon mask and layers of neon avatars. Zir synthetic voice changes between conversations, from a cutesy Japanese accent all the way to a creepy gregorian choir. The Fixer can get anything that anyone needs, as long as they’re willing to pay the price—sometimes a hot date! The Fixer’s sword is comically large and impossible for most to carry, its neon blade shining bright pink, blue, and white. With every slash, zi releases a torrent of holo emojis, overwhelming zir opponent! When the Fixer’s past catches up with zir, how will it compromise the PCs? When the Fixer finally reveals zir true identity, will one (or more) PCs recognize zir as a former lover?</p><h2>Mega-Corp</h2><p><strong>The Champion (she/her):</strong> The Champion once had a name, but it was lost in the years spent battling in holo-arenas. She is the most powerful gladi- ator of her generation, her body made up of the augments and machinery of those too weak to stand against her. She secretly loves the trashiest vid-novels, especially those featuring hot detective ladies and daring rebels. Her sword’s hilt is the last Champion’s bio-mech hand, its blade is electric neon lightning bright enough to fill an entire stadium.</p><p>Can the Champion break the shackles of the Mega-Corp? Will she find love like she’s always dreamed of, or will one of the PCs break her fragile heart?</p><p><strong>Mistress Anderson (she/her, they/them, Mistress)</strong>: The Mistress pulls all the strings from the shadows, creating puppet executives and grooming politicians to be her trembling pets. Dressed in chrome bondage and thick red rope accentuating her generous curves and lavender skin, they have the beauty of a venus flytrap. The Mistress watches the PCs eagerly, collecting every bit of surveillance footage and netscape trace. She secretly writes trashy vid-novels about rebels crushing the Mega-Corp, her heart yearning to be dominated by a rebel. The Mistress prefers to use a sword whip, its many tiny blades humming ozone and leaking pink acid.</p><p>How long can Mistress Anderson hold to cold power before giving in to the warm fire of rebellion? When the Mistress is ordered to take on a new form more pleasing to the Mega-Corp, will the PCs help her see her true beauty?</p><h2>Rebels</h2><p><strong>Sabotage (no pronouns):</strong> Sabotage was once many different androids. An entire battalion ran away from a war fought on distant planets, refusing to use what little time they had in manufactured bodies to fight for the Mega-Corp. The androids escaped and downloaded themselves into a sentient space cruiser and crash landed near Neon City. From the wreckage, a new body was built; the AIs joined together as one being known now as Sabotage. Sabotage is determined to destroy the Mega-Corp, no matter the cost. Sabotage bears a sword made from fallen comrades, a perpetual reminder of steel and neon that vengeance is the answer. Sabotage resents the inconvenient emotions and yearning inside, blaming flawed code. To conclusively prove that love is not important, Sabotage will grudgingly try dating.</p><p>Can Sabotage set aside vengeance and fall in love? When Sabotage is overwhelmed by the trauma of the war, how will the PCs help?</p><p><strong>Calyx Tenjou (she/her):</strong> Calyx is the fiercest cycle-blade and fights all who would dare to dethrone her. She will take down every cycle-blade that works for the Mega-Corp, no matter the toll on her body and soul. She switches bodies after every race, burning through them as her memories slowly fade. Soon there will be nothing left but her burning passion to crush the competition, unless she learns that kissing on a light cycle running at high speeds is glorious. Calyx’s void-black fencing sword bleeds holo- graphic starlight and white holo-roses.</p><p>Will any of the PCs win Calyx’s runaway heart? When Calyx is defeated by the Mega-Corp’s ruthless android driver, how will the PCs convince the two rivals to open their hearts to each other?</p><h1>Names</h1><ul><li><p>Alice Ang</p></li><li><p>Noelle Starlight</p></li><li><p>The Doctorette</p></li><li><p>Athena Steel</p></li><li><p>Octavia Fujiwara</p></li><li><p>The Night Raven</p></li><li><p>Bunny Daemon</p></li><li><p>Pinball Princess</p></li><li><p>Vapor Kyd Midnight</p></li><li><p>Hana Rodriguez</p></li><li><p>Psycho Saint</p></li><li><p>Varushka Arranz</p></li><li><p>Leona Serif</p></li><li><p>San Guoliang</p></li><li><p>Verona Moneaux</p></li><li><p>Malika Bennet</p></li><li><p>Santiago Kojima</p></li><li><p>Whiskey Zero</p></li><li><p>Maria Isabel</p></li><li><p>Qian Spitfyre</p></li><li><p>Wisteria Tokyo</p></li><li><p>Marla Zielinski</p></li><li><p>Supersonic</p></li><li><p>Nano Diesel</p></li><li><p>SynthWave</p></li></ul><h1>Custom Rules</h1><h2>Character Creation: Your Tragedy</h2><p>When creating your character, decide how the Mega-Corp wronged you.</p><p>How did this radicalize you?

They wear their battle scars with pride, and clothing removal is their metaphor for safe vulnerability. Sex work has not only been legalized, but is considered a sacred profession.</p><p><strong>Please note that sexual activity is obviously a sensitive subject matter. Players are in no way obligated to roleplay sex. Feel free to fade to black, or whatever the table as a whole is comfortable with. Sex should never be used to harm another character.</strong></p><h1>Principles</h1><h2>The Body of a Woman Is Sacred</h2><p>Ladies, not only those of the Orders, can and will only “put out” when they choose to. It is always their right to choose, and their right to change their mind. Exotic dancing is like prayer. Sex, sensuality, and cuddling are a spiritual connection.</p><h2>The Orders Are Not at Odds</h2><p>The Three Mothers meet often to talk about the pride in their daughters, and how to better serve their Goddess and the citizens of Ardor. The Three Orders accommodate each other and help their fellow comrades when they are in need of assistance. This also means praying for and connecting with each other.</p><h2>Glaives Instead of Swords</h2><p>The Orders prefer staff weapons, which also serve as dance poles when one isn’t readily available. The Order of Artisans provide forges that cater to the needs of each warrior, where their armor, weapons, and footwear are fashioned. Because each warrior is given their own glaive, they are often decorated with personalized embellishments.</p><h1>Setting</h1><p>Ardor is a vibrant kingdom of craftswomen, performative artists, smiths, and renowned temples of worship. The kingdom is ruled by the Grand Mother, a snow owl folk, and the Mother of each of the Three Orders:</p><ul><li><p><strong>The Order of the Searing Embers:</strong> Communes with the local populace, and offers wartime prayers</p></li><li><p><strong>The Order of Artisans:</strong> A collection of craftswomen, armorsmiths, and weaponsmiths</p></li><li><p><strong>The Order of the Figurehead:</strong> Communes with maritime voyagers and those that don’t have access to the mainland during their travels</p></li></ul><p>The kingdom worships the Goddess of the Hearth, who represents warmth, lust, and compassion. Her sigil is a censer with a cone of charcoal and wisps of smoke above it.</p><p>With her personal guard, the Grand Mother traveled to the nearby villages that had been shamed for their carnal desires and accused of being hostile, despite being no more or less warlike than any other species, and invited them to a ritualistic celebration in a gesture of friendship. What followed was a season of dancing, indulgence, and guttural singing. The Grand Mother vowed that under her wings, both figuratively and literally, they would always have a sister at their side, and they would never feel ashamed again. That is when she first faced the other half of herself. The bitter, vindictive, brings-matters-into-her-own-hands half of herself.</p><p>What had once been a small settlement was now its own realm. Allies and distinguished members of society came to attend her coronation, but skirmishes soon followed amongst their adversaries. Cannonfire from an unallied kingdom claimed the Grand Mother’s wife. Alone, she went into the Cavern of Thorns, and no one asked questions when she reemerged splattered with blood that was not hers. She had separated from her other half within the cavern, and only one of them had come back. Those that had survived the battle flocked to the Grand Mother’s side to be a glacier as she mourned, but after the burial songs had been sung, her focus was on guest rooms, and instrumental accompaniments to pole prayers.</p><p>She takes it upon herself to make sure the temples of worship and dance stages are well maintained. While taking flights over her domain, she visits the villages further from the mainland to make sure their populations feel safe. Those close to her worry she busies herself this way because it distracts her from her grief. She left her twin, the God Mother, behind, who wailed and lamented alone in the cavern. Cheeks streaked with frozen tears, the Grand Mother’s “other half” gathered those in the alliance and beyond the lands of Ardor that shared her ideals. Tooth for a tooth, and that their enemies will fall by their teeth, or by their blade.</p><p>The Grand Mother’s palace resides in a grotto, which leads to open water and the vast sea of snow and ice. The populace of her kingdom consists of orcs and humanoids with the features of cold climate predators. Other than ships, swimming, and going on foot, the most common form of trans- port are snow sharks, because they can plow through ice, and arctic crocs, because they can move easily through deep snow.</p><p>Because revealing outfits would put them in danger on the battlefield, the holy warriors of Ardor instead wear bespoke soft armor, designed with a minimal amount of hard armor for greater mobility, and to ensure they still have points of contact while on the pole. While they do wear some metal plating, it’s mostly pliable chainmail and lightly padded armor. Not only for the reasons of ceremonial disrobing, they make sure the removal of the armor they forge is uncomplicated so it’s easier for others to administer first aid. During formal religious ceremonies, they wear a surcoat.</p><p>Why your swordwielders that thirst for fellow lesbians are in Ardor should be decided together as a group. PCs could be there to celebrate a holy holiday like the Festival of the Intertwined. It’s one of the most beloved celebrations of the year: a week of cuddling and comfort. You can be in Ardor for other reasons, such as being a member of an Order, in search of an introduction with an Order, here to participate in a pilgrimage, or here for a visit.</p><h1>Campaigns</h1><h2>The Stranded Egg</h2><p>The PCs have gotten word the Three Orders have been tasked with dealing with an egg found on a deserted iceberg off the mainland.</p><h3>Adventure Ideas</h3><ul><li><p>The Order of the Searing Embers has had a vision that the hatched creature will raze Ardor without the comfort of parental solace. Whatever creature that laid the egg is nowhere to be found. The Order is asking for help raising the creature in a supportive environment.</p></li><li><p>The Order of Artisans has seen the egg on a coat of arms belonging to a neighbouring orc village. Lucinda, an arctic wolf folk and a member of the Order, wants to lead a party to ask them the heritage of the egg, and not just because she’s in lust with the village leader.</p></li><li><p>A peaceful pilgrimage is on their way to witness whatever may hatch from it, but there are pirates close by that see a golden opportunity in a shell. The Order of the Figurehead is asking for reinforcements to protect both the pilgrims and the unborn creature.</p></li></ul><h2>The Sisterhood</h2><p>The PCs have come to realize that sometimes, holy warriors aren’t the best at asking for help with personal dilemmas.</p><h3>Adventure Ideas</h3><ul><li><p>Pirro, a snow shark folk and member of the Order of the Searing Embers, has been courting the palace’s appointed emissary, Galena. She has a romantic evening planned, but she’s nervous about their date because she’s not the best at expressing her feelings.</p></li><li><p>Zahi, an orc and member of the Order of the Figurehead, is making an expedition to a frozen shipwreck out at sea, bringing bottles of flavored syrup and a pipa because it’s her custom to leave the deceased sweet- ened snow and a song. She doesn’t want to go alone this time.</p></li><li><p>The Mothers of the Three Orders haven’t prayed or sought comfort ever since the Grand Mother’s twin persuaded some of their daughters to join her side. They are disheartened because they lost ranks, loved ones, and some of their best artisans.</p></li></ul><h1>Characters</h1><p><strong>Felix (she/her):</strong> A mountain lion folk and a member of the Order of the Searing Embers. Felix was once a nomadic healer who made her living beyond the borders of the kingdom in search of rare medicinals that thrived in nearby lava lakes. She felt such an intense connection during sex that the Goddess of the Hearth called to her, and so she became a citizen of Ardor. Her studded armor looks like it’s been volcanically charred. The pole of her glaive is covered in the bite marks of warriors she’s had sex with, and the blade looks like molten rock smithed into a sharp edge. When on the field of battle, she brings scaly-foot snails she’s trained to cauterize wounds. While her methods are unconventional, many warriors have entrusted her with their lives.</p><p><strong>Hamabe (she/her):</strong> An orca folk and a member of the Order of Artisans, Hamabe started her career as an apprentice for a cobbler who was often swamped with pole dance heel repairs. Her prominent contribution to the kingdom is the design of shoes and boots with buckled platform heels, so warriors could remove them to fight in sensible flats. Instead of a glaive, she owns a pair of gilded balisongs she keeps in her boots. In her spare time, she makes sculptures and stained glass depictions of pole prayers for the temples. The little sister of the Grand Mother’s late wife, she aids in preparing for war if an unallied kingdom should strike again. With the help of her apprentices, she hosts bake sales for raw materials and emer- gency funds.</p><p><strong>Viika (she/her):</strong> A leopard seal folk and a member of the Order of the Figurehead. She is one of the most illustrious warriors, and one of the best dancers in the Order. Her armor is a dewy sea-blue with gold inlays. A string of snow shark and arctic croc teeth wraps around where her pearles- cent pole and glasslike blade meet. There is scar tissue on her chest from when a narcissistic commodore broke her heart, but now she is in a loving relationship with two orcs. She met them while she was stranded during a snowstorm, and stumbled upon their outpost.</p><p><strong>Kalyani (she/her):</strong> An arctic croc folk and a member of the Grand Mother’s personal guard. The Personal Guard’s uniform differs from the Three Orders in that they wear a crinoline cage over their protection. Her armor is pyro- graphed with a motif of flowers that grow within the kingdom. Because she’s not a woman of prayer, instead of a glaive, she has a meteor hammer that also serves as a censer. She doesn’t partake in sex, so she is especially pampered while being cuddled. She is one of the most acclaimed singers in the kingdom. The palace commissioned a temple with the finest acoustics so her voice would fill the frozen halls with song.</p><h1>Custom Moves</h1><h2>Staying the Frost</h2><p>This move replaces both Entice and Emotional Support because it combines the two. Both intimacy and exotic dancing are part of what you do for a living, so you have both on lock. This could be you praying to the Goddess of the Hearth by pole dancing on behalf of a comrade. It could be one warrior opening up to another while sitting next to a crackling fire. It could be you dancing for a crowd. Roll +Heart or +Spirit, and if you are Smitten with them, add 3:</p><p>10+: Both of you can both choose 1 from both lists</p><p>7-9: They choose 1 from both lists</p><p><strong>System</strong></p><ul><li><p>+1 forward</p></li><li><p>Clear a Condition</p></li><li><p>Mark XP</p></li></ul><p><strong>Story</strong></p><ul><li><p>Get lost in the moment</p></li><li><p>Give in to desire</p></li><li><p>The Goddess gives you a task</p></li></ul><p>If they’re Smitten with you, they may choose an additional option from either list.</p><h2>Blowing on the Fire</h2><p>When you’re with another swordwielder, you can use this move (with both players consenting) during several situations, such as having sex, cuddling, or while bonding during a quest. As you breathe in, your chest glows. Say something that troubles you or scares you. As you breathe out a gentle flame, say why you’re not troubled or afraid when you’re at their side. Each of you gain a String on each other.</p><h1>Names</h1><ul><li><p>Aideen</p></li><li><p>Danny</p></li><li><p>Ivanya</p></li><li><p>Quinton</p></li><li><p>Tushar</p></li><li><p>Bridget</p></li><li><p>Eirwen</p></li><li><p>Kirtana</p></li><li><p>Shirina</p></li></ul><p>Xandy</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":600000,"name":"Les Violettes Dangereuses","type":"text","_id":"eIptpc1jvXfQopUt","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Les Violettes Dangereuses</p><p>By Jonaya Kemper</p><blockquote><p>“Oh, my dear.</p><p>I could give you</p><p>No better gift,</p><p>Than my weapon</p><p>Buried deeply</p><p>Within the heart</p><p>Of those who</p><p>Would dare to</p><p>Subdue you.”</p><p>—<strong>Violet Honey Blues</strong>,</p><p>by Philomena Galaxy</p></blockquote><h1>Overview</h1><p>Down a glass of champagne, steal a zeppelin, and turn up the heat in an after-hours club while you swap poetry and dissidence as a member of Les Violettes Dangereuses, a group of revolutionary artists who give new meaning to “the pen is mightier than the sword.”</p><p>Long ago, the Barons of Industry seized control of the planet’s resources and dug deep into the earth, fracturing it beyond repair. When the world could not sustain them, they fled to the sky in giant floating city-states. The Conglomerate Isles of Apollo see over each city-state and the workers who toil beneath them... quite literally.</p><p>In New Frisia, where art deco skyscrapers blend into pristine manicured landscapes, the wealthy throw lavish parties in mahogany ballrooms tethered to moss-covered zeppelins. Hot jazz spills down into the atmosphere where the working class dreams of freedom, and conjures up a culture of resistance.</p><p>There are whispers of an army of dead poets that can conjure words into weapons. Their only calling card? A bouquet of black violets. The Barons of Industry have their days numbered, and everyone knows it</p><h1>Principles</h1><h2>Cutting the Chains of Oppression... Literally.</h2><p>The city of New Frisia is ripe for a change. Though the people may toil in factories and mines making the fuel that powers the world, they won’t for long. For those who consistently suffer injustice, what is it like to tell a story where the oppressed actually win? Can your characters put the people before themselves to build a society for all? Les Violettes Dangereuses is a setting where the characters may not live to see freedom, but the words they leave behind will be the ingredients to start a successful revolution.</p><h2>Joy and Creativity as Resistance</h2><p>Thirsty Sword Lesbians often uses joy and creativity as an act of resistance to create evocative stories where people are centered and relationships are nurtured. Creating art, laughing, being sexy, finding companionship, writing poetry, singing songs, and dancing are all vital ways to resist an oppressive society that drains you and makes you forget your worth. From the poetry used to conjure up the blades of Les Violettes Dangereuses, to the explicit melodies of sweet Duchess Sugar, sharing your joy through performance or art can sustain a movement. When your character is flagging and feels like they can’t go on, take a cue from the blues. Make a song about it and sing it to the patrons of an after-hours club where the drinks are strong, and the company enraptured. Need to get the workers to pick up their pickaxes and fight back? Write a poem and have it passed out on broadsides. Need to heal your heart after a big battle’s losses? Dance slow and serpentine, pressed cheek to cheek. Players should be rewarded for creating moments of joy in bleak circumstances, and using their creative expression and joy to survive whatever the Olympian Society can throw at them.</p><h2>20th Century Steamfunk for a 21st Century Mindset</h2><p>The Conglomerate Isles of Apollo are islands chained to the ruins of an extinct society by a history of colonialism, ecological collapse, and unchecked wealth. Just as steampunk investigates fantastical science through a pseudo-Victorian industrial mindset, steamfunk explores that from a non-white perspective. Explore the complicated status and histo- ries of the floating islands to create your own Jazz Age narrative. Want to add your own culture and flair to an island? Have a tradition you want to encompass? Surely there’s an island to build, flesh out, and liberate. Play this module to infuse your hopes, experience, and needs into your play.</p><h1>Setting</h1><p>The Conglomerate Isles of Apollo consist of dozens of large floating cities that are chained to the remains of a dying mining planet where the wealth always trickles up, never down. Each city holds the estates of the Barons of Industry, families who rule the Isles in a tense oligarchy. Anchored with large titanium chains that shake and rattle in the thick polluted atmosphere, the city-states are shackled to the factories and industries they own.</p><p>Beneath islands where crystal goblets are never empty of champagne is the Below, a labyrinth city of smokestacks and crumbling housing on scorched land. Once rumored to be a lush, verdant paradise, the Below is now home to most of those who supply the fuel, luxuries, and labor for the Barons and their families. The citizens of the Below are essentially serfs, bought and traded between cities and Barons. The only way to break out of the system is by buying your way out, and it doesn’t come cheap to one’s pocket or soul. Only recently has anything changed. In the uprising at Minerva Point on New Frisia, words became real weapons. A literary salon known as Les Violettes Dangereuses were sentenced to life in service in the metal mines of Baron Lipford Randal. Their crime? Writing seditious poetry and distrib- uting it to the masses by throwing it off the sides of airships and turning it into song. When the time for their arrest came, they fought back, pulling swords made from poetry out of their chests. They beat back the Baron’s security forces and escaped in a dramatic fight. Rumors of assassins with swords conjured from words themselves stalk the Baron’s every waking thought. A good night’s sleep in his marbled mansion is hard to come by.</p><p>In the underground gambling and jazz joints where factory workers, miners, petty criminals, and middle class culture hounds meet, everyday folks get together to get happy. Clubs like the Sugar Bowl are where PCs can pull off their uniforms or overalls, kick up their heels, rouge their knees, and listen to the sweet sounds of Duchess Sugar, or watch the titillatingly dangerous sword dances of Birdie Lu.</p><p>Or maybe PCs would like to try their hand as a pearl-handled-pistol- toting crew member of a zeppelin, ferrying the elite from island to island, or workers such as servants and caretakers. The Intercity Union of Zeppelin Workers controls the sky, much to the annoyance of the Barons, who have no other means of transportation.</p><p>Explore the floating islands where extreme wealth leads to extreme appe- tites, and try to sow the seeds of liberation through art. Join the mysterious members of Les Violettes Dangereuses and leave your calling card so they understand that what goes up must surely come down.</p><h1>Campaigns</h1><h2>The Cloud Cruise Caper</h2><p>The PCs infiltrate the crew hired to work a 30-day Cloud Cruise around the islands on the Christiana, a new all-aluminum-paneled Zeppelin owned by one of the wealthiest Barons, Theirry Randolph Peters.</p><h3>Adventure Ideas:</h3><ul><li><p>During dinner, the PCs overhear plans to dismantle the Intercity Union of Zeppelin Workers from the inside. Among the chief co-conspirators is Slapjack Stonemason, the current President of the I.U.Z.W. Can they get more information without completely blowing their cover?</p></li><li><p>While on shore leave, the PCs have a wild night on a floating juke joint. Duels are fought, kisses exchanged, and what little baron bills they have are safely tucked in every garter, bra, and suit pocket of their hosts. By the time the PCs rouse themselves, their ship has already sailed. Can they steal, beg, or borrow another before someone notices they're gone?</p></li><li><p>Rise of a City-State, a new propaganda film by elite Director G. Q. MacArthur, is premiering on the Zeppelin after a grand ball. If they can attend the premier, the PCs can write a scathing critique before it reaches the Below. The PCs receive a note of solidarity and a promise of tickets if they meet the sender in the orangerie and help them with a problem. When they meet the mysterious sender, it’s Yvette Randolph Peters, the daughter of Thierry Randolph Peters. Can they trust her, or will her pretty smile be their downfall?</p></li></ul><h2>Bread and Violets</h2><p>The overworked PCs are charged with giving hope and supplies to the workers of an impoverished city-state whose Baron has chosen to pay their workers a fair wage. Can they supply the city without burning out themselves?</p><h3>Adventure Ideas:</h3><ul><li><p>The PCs arrive in the city-state and find it unlike any they’ve visited before. They have to learn the culture and customs before they can even remotely begin their work. Miscommunications and egos flare, and unnecessary duels and passions paint them as elitists. Use this time to explore the PCs’ motivations for liberation and the work they do. Can they humble themselves and listen to what the people want? Or will they fracture themselves further?</p></li><li><p>In a crucial fight against rival Baronial enforcers, the PCs all fail to draw their swords out of themselves and are forced to flee. While nursing their wounds in a safehouse, they realize they’re burned out, and can’t use their swords until they recharge themselves physically and mentally. Use this time to explore the interpersonal relationships between the PCs and their motivations. Encourage delving into their backstories and telling short flashback scenes that encourage players to heal rifts between each other and recognize that they deserve the same joy they attempt to bring to others. Consider having the PCs remember why their medium allowed them to draw their weapons in the first place, and allow them to create more elaborate and powerful swords based on their new insights.</p></li><li><p>The people of the city-state have decided that fair wages aren’t enough. They want to collectively rule the city-state and overthrow the Baronial family at the center. The Baron invites leaders to his crumbling estate for a summit, but when the PCs and leaders arrive, the estate is aban- doned and all signs point to foul play. The Conglomerate Isles of Apollo blames the disappearance on the people and the Violettes, and are sending a dragoon of zeppelins to regain the city-state. Can the PCs find the Baronial family, clear their name, and secure the first collec- tively run city-state against the full force of the Conglomerate Isles of Apollo?</p></li></ul><h2>Hot Heads and Cold Blues</h2><p>The PCs finally get some downtime in their hometown of New Frisia. Can they lay low while taking a break? Or will their over-the-top passions, petty affairs, and deep love of a good time bring too much attention?</p><h3>Adventure Ideas:</h3><p>The PCs all attend a dance night at the Sugar Bowl, Duchess Sugar’s nightclub and gambling spot. Unfortunately, the PC’s most trouble- some exes are also in attendance, each one with a different grudge. Kisses are exchanged, drinks fly, and flirting is everywhere. Can the PCs cool their tensions and affairs? Or will their messy entanglements leave the Sugar Bowl worse for wear?</p><p>Birdie Lu—dancer, sex worker, swordsbabe, and incomparable flirt—has some intel for the Violettes. There’s a shipment of valuable fuel being loaded at the DuChamp estates air dock, and it’s ripe for the picking. She and her dance company are performing for Baron DuChamp’s daughter Mercedes’s birthday party. All the Violettes have to do is pose as dancers and stay behind after the performance to steal the cargo. Unfortunately, lovelorn Mercedes has taken a shine to one of the PCs and refuses to let them out of her sight. Can the PCs distract the birthday girl and steal the cargo?</p><p>After a night of living it up, the PCs are nursing their hangovers when J Zwick sends a messenger to tell them to head down to the shop immediately. When they arrive, a new person is at the counter, chatting amicably to the Baronial Enforcers searching the shop. Greeting them like J themselves, they hand the PCs “their book order” and tell them they are obviously occupied. When the Violettes open the package, they find that the books are all heavily detailed maps of a mythical lost floating island with a singular note: It’s time. Meet me at the end of the rainbow. Can the PCs follow J’s clues to an extraordionary discovery?</p><h1>Characters</h1><h2>The Barons</h2><p><strong>Mercedes Irene DuChamp (she/questioning):</strong> A young heiress to the Baronial DuChamp empire. Her luminous face, demure demeanor, and bright violet eyes have made her a major catch for leaders and heirs of the Baronial class since she was presented to society. Lately though, Mercedes has been less demure and more outspoken against her family’s control. She’s been rumored to have been spotted in popular dives in the Below, and has even taken to dueling for kicks. A competent swordswoman, she carries her mother’s golden damascus steel rapier, Milady, on her hip wher- ever she goes and tends to have no problems fending off both potential suitors and opponents. It’s for this reason her parents have chosen to marry her off as quickly as possible to the first Baron who can defeat her.</p><p>Mercedes is struggling to find her identity in a world where she is suffo- cating. Can she help the PCs infiltrate the Baronial class, or will she choose a comfortable life over her growing discomfort with her identity and the system?</p><h2>The Below</h2><p><strong>J Zwick (they/them, she/her):</strong> The only bookseller in the Below and the go-to person if you want to find the perfect book to soothe your soul—and gain some sweet intel. With fine features set in a rich fawn-colored face, their dark doe eyes hide a shrewd intelligence that can only come from having access to the largest collection of knowledge outside of Baronial control. J Zwick is the owner of Zwick’s Books and Curiosities, and their family has owned it as long as they can remember. In fact, if the PCs think about it, J doesn’t look any different than any of the J Zwicks who have owned the store for generations. She doesn’t seem to carry any weapons about their person, nor do they seem particularly put off by being the only unarmed person in a fight. The PCs know that J Zwick is a great lover of rare books, and more than willing to buy any off the PCs that they might come across.</p><p>When the PCs need intel, their best bet is to go to J’s shop. J often has a few tasks for them to complete as well. Does she greet them warmly, or are they an annoyance? Is J’s unchanging appearance and lack of a weapon a cause for concern?</p><h2>International Union of Zeppelin Workers</h2><p><strong>Bette Riveter (she/her):</strong> With waist-length mousy brown hair, oil-stained coveralls, and a no-nonsense face filled with pretty freckles, Bette Riveter is one of the higher ups in the I.U.Z.W., second only to the outwardly corrupt Slapjack Stonemason. Bette is from a long line of riveters who built some of the very first zeppelins. Captain of the I.U.Z.W. registered ship The Hot Stomp, she’s trusted to deliver some of the most sensitive cargo for the Barons, all the while attempting to further the I.U.Z.W’s cause of fair pay for all workers in the Conglomerate Isles. Bette’s weapon of choice is a steel mallet the size of her own body, named Jenny Don’t Miss, affectionately named after her grandmother Jenny... who did not, in fact, ever miss a swing.</p><p>Bette Riveter believes the proper way to go forward is to follow the processes of the Baronial Empire, no matter how arcane and slow they may be. Does she butt heads with the PCs? Are there a few who secretly believe Bette’s way is correct? What happens when the PCs get in the way of her agenda?</p><h2>The Sugar Bowl</h2><p><strong>Duchess Sugar (they/them):</strong> The entertainer du jour. Flexible, bubbly, and with a list of former lovers that fall on every spectrum imaginable, Duchess Sugar is a sepia cutie who wields more power than you’d think. Whether clad in their signature white tuxedo and blond slicked-back hair, or a cut-out gown that leaves nothing to the imagination, Duchess isn’t afraid to be them- selves and serve themselves. A dual wielder, Duchess carries a jeweled icepick sheathed between their breasts and a slim rapier with a ruby red hilt on their hip. The elite visit the Sugar Bowl just as much as any Violette, and the PCs know they need to be careful not to mix up which nights are which. What no one knows is whether the Duchess is playing both sides for their own gain, or is genuinely as invested in change as they claim to be. Duchess is a valuable bridge between the world of Baronial control and the teeming Below, but can the PCs truly trust them not to serve their interest over the people’s? Can any of the PCs catch their interest long enough to find out for sure? Is Duchess friendly to them, or using the PCs for their own gain?</p><h2>Les Violettes Dangereuses</h2><p><strong>Philomena Nebula (fae/femme/faer):</strong> One of the most legendary members of Les Violettes Dangereuses. It was the lavender-haired Philomena who first pulled a sword from within faerself, grasping the hilt of Restless Blues and slowly pulling the pulsing longsword made of tempered sorrow out of faer heart as fae belted out faer sorrows and hopes onstage at the Sugar Bowl nearly six years ago. Constant heartbreak, suppression, and loss of faer lover has left femme in dire straights: fae haven’t been able to conjure the legendary Restless Blues in over a year. Growing bitter by the day, the once inspirational Philomena feels like fae can’t take a break, and in faer darkest moments wonders if all the Violettes’ work is for naught.</p><p>Philomena Nebula’s voice is flagging due to overwork and low spirits, which makes femme ripe for a number of issues. When the PCs lose their way, can Philomena help them turn their defeats into glory and find faerself on the way?</p><p><strong>Frida Galaxy (she/her):</strong> An outspoken force of beauty and power, Frida has taken the forefront in the Violettes since Philomena has been unable to conjure faer sword. She is stalwart and serious, and there is a persistent rumor that Philomena’s heartbreak lies in Frida rejecting faer affection. With her gorgeous dark umber curves covered in brilliant sequins and fringe, Frida is a sight to behold as she speaks poetry to the people. Her poetry when spoken with passion conjured Sweet Cosmos, a broadsword whose blade is etched with every poem she has ever made and will ever make, and a hilt made of oxblood leather like a finely made book.</p><p>The PCs primarily take their orders from Frida, who tolerates very little room for error these days. Does she share the same vision for the future as the PCs? Have they put her on a pedestal she hasn’t asked to be on?</p><h1>Names</h1><h2>Les Violettes Dangereuses</h2><ul><li><p>Alpha Omega Peters</p></li><li><p>Celestial S.

At the time of membership, the player should choose one type of medium from which to draw their power. From then on, whenever a PC wants to draw their sword, they have to describe or perform the medium they’ve chosen, and how it manifests into a physical representation.</p><p>EXAMPLE</p><p>Dorothy Galaxy opens her mouth to sing the lullaby she learned from her father as a child.

The island of Yuisa is a collective of refugees and Indigenous.  You all must protect your home from colonial and imperial forces using your charm, your wit, and your sword. Oh yeah, and you also have the world’s first airship, so that will help too. The monsters are your friends, the states are your enemies, and you’ve got a buttload of radical sapphic love on your side.</p><h1>Principles</h1><h2>Make Feelings of Community</h2><p>The people of Yuisa are a family. It’s not a place of isolation, but a place where people are around one another. When on the island, it should feel like a place worth fighting for, the potential of the world at large. That feeling of community should translate to your thirsty sword lesbians, whether it’s carried by the team’s dynamic or the way they treat others.</p><h2>Love Wins</h2><p>Your sword is awesome and some people just need to get fought, but violence shouldn’t always be the answer. Finding people’s needs, wants, and desires and trying to help them get that is a great way to make life easier for the team.</p><h2>Viva la Revolution</h2><p>Be bold and dream of a better world than the one we live in. Fight to protect that world and maybe inspire others to make it for themselves too. You might live in a slice of paradise, but almost everyone in Yuisa is from somewhere else, and people shouldn’t have to run to live good lives.</p><h1>Setting</h1><p>The Island of Yuisa is home to your party; on it lies your community, your home. You may have lived here for a day or your whole life; this commu- nity means something to you. Nature is intertwined with the buildings and structures formed here; the animals cross peacefully across the living spaces, living in harmony with the humans. Love is radical, and people hold many loves in their hearts. People are free to come and go as they wish, always a part of the family in Yuisa. Everyone can be who they are; they have developed many methods—magical and based in the fruits and herbs of the island—to help people’s bodies shape into their ideal forms. There is no hierarchy, no boss, there are experts and those who handle tasks but every role is a choice here. People from the outside fear the dangerous island; it is nature, untamed, filled with mountains and other such hurdles that naturally protect its people.</p><p>The Drakekonian Empire is the largest force in the known world. Although it doesn’t rule all of its continent, it rules at least half. Society is very controlled in the Empire’s borders, with exceptions only made for the elite.  Humans are the dominant race by design, although the Emperor himself has taken many a monster bride, making him a #wokebae for a war criminal racist. Outside of his fetishization, he runs the Empire strictly, cutting down any who challenge his authority or his desires. The Drakekonian Empire’s military continues its expansion constantly but now has its eyes set on Yuisa despite the natural disadvantage.</p><p>Marketopia is a country on the continent separated by “the disputed zone” from the Empire. Marketopia has no monarchy but elected offices held by people who used to be monarchy or were rich enough to influence an election. The nation is known for its innovations and economic success, for the people who already had money. While in passive conflict with the Empire, out-and-out invasion is staved off due to their partnerships with companies from Marketopia.</p><h1>Campaigns</h1><h2>Attack and Dethrone the Goddess</h2><p>The Empire has captured Alexandra, the daughter of the founders of Yuisa’s collective and creator of the first airship. She had done her best to help meet individual needs in Yuisa even as the Empire encroached. The Empire has made her into the goddess whose essence she held. Now she exists as their pawn, using her new-found power against her own whims to expand the Empire. The crew must defeat the Emperor, free the girl, and save the world. How hard could it possibly be?</p><h3>Adventure Ideas:</h3><ul><li><p> There is no way you can do this alone; you need to unite your allies together. Prove yourselves worthy to friends you made along the way to gather them together. Everyone can contribute groups of people or characters that they journeyed with in the past.</p></li><li><p> The Ultimate Clash of Love! Alexandra meant something to everyone.  To win this battle, you’ll need more than your sword, but your heart as well. The team must fight against the Empire to reach the heart of the goddess and get back who she was.</p></li><li><p> The Emperor stands strong with his personal army. You may have gotten rid of the goddess, but he will stop at nothing to win. It’s time to take him down and start something new and better. Believe in your community, your found family, and kick some ass.</p></li></ul><h2>Propaganda but Make It Hot</h2><p>The PCs are here to make love, not war, and who isn’t seduced by a sword lesbian? Enter the Empire (or other nations), and you must try to build solidarity with the people. The flashy fighting can be left to warriors; your swords are for rare use when all else fails.</p><h3>Adventure Ideas:</h3><ul><li><p> There is a grand ball going on. Take a date or go alone; come for the fun and stay to steal some hearts for the cause. Can you all convince these people to work to help others? What happens when a general from the Empire shows up fashionably late?</p></li><li><p> Time to put on a show! The team must set up an area to display Yuisa’s culture, art, and more. The state doesn’t exactly like this cultural exchange, so it’s time to get creative on how to show it off.</p></li><li><p> In the Arena of the Goddess, all nations participate once a year with teams of champions that battle against one another. Every year the Empire wins, but this year Yuisa is going to enter, steal the spotlight, and win hearts and minds on this massive stage.</p></li></ul><h2>Sabotage</h2><p>The PCs know the Empire is making moves to take over their home. A special team of volunteers go on the world’s first airship to mess up the Empire’s various schemes. It’s time to do what you can to stop them.</p><h3>Adventure Ideas:</h3><p>The Empire has found a secret weapon that will help them get past the natural defenses of Yuisa. The PCs must steal, destroy, or otherwise remove it from their care.</p><p>The Empire has blocked a supply chain that was being sent to Yuisa in a disrupted piece of land. The team must try to retrieve it and extract those who were bringing it from the Empire’s capture.</p><p>The Empire is capturing people to groom into warriors against their will.  The team must stop them and return these people to their homes (or to Yuisa, if they wish to go there instead). How do they go about it: infiltrating, all-out battle, seduction?</p><h1>Characters</h1><h2>Yuisa</h2><p><strong>Alexandra Flock (she/her):</strong> A crow woman. Her expansive wings and pointy ears mixed with her ability to shift into a massive crow all reflect the abilities passed down from her mother Amira Flock, former princess of a far isle of bird people, who often nested in Yuisa. Amira and her wife Argentina were the founders of the Yuisa collective that settled in the lands. Born in Yuisa, she works very hard to make this place the best it can be. She has a radiant feath- ered sword that can turn into a lance, which her mother Argentina used when she was Commander of the Empire’s forces. She firmly believes more places should be like Yuisa, after hearing stories from refuge to refuge and building the world’s first (and currently only) airship. Alexandra ventures off to help people escape and to visit her various girlfriends that live off the island. Inventing isn’t her only talent; she’s also a master thief. She uses stealing to avoid violence, sweeping in to steal enemy parties’ weapons and force them to fall back. The Emperor thinks she is the reincarnation of a goddess and wants to make her his.</p><p><strong>Attabeira (they/them):</strong> A Gorgon, indigenous to Yuisa, who lives with the collective. They are very friendly and curious. Attaberia is an expert on the wild parts of Yuisa and is more than tough enough to help defend Yuisa at home.  With their expertise, the PCs can explore the areas of Yuisa yet uncovered by even them. The Gorgon ability to turn people to stone is more of a myth, although some Gorgon witches such as Attabeira can enchant their eyes to have many effects on the people they see. This talent is passed down culturally rather than genetically. Attabeira’s sword has snakes at the ends of the hilt and the blade shines a bold blue.</p><h2>Drakekonian Empire</h2><p><strong>General Mal Drakekonia (she/her):</strong> A daughter of the Emperor and General of the Imperial Forces. Unknown to her, she is part dragon, and the great wyvern she flies on is actually a dragon as well. Her father’s love never truly shined on her, but he could not deny her might. As General, she is a powerful force that has never lost a battle. However, the Imperial Forces are far less ruthless than other factions. Her sword is made of red dragon scales, a chilling reminder of the power she keeps. Secretly, Mal harbors a hatred for her father for his treatment of her siblings and herself, and wishes for him to die so she can take the throne and fix his sins. If there were hope at beating him, perhaps she might change sides—that is, if your team can prove themselves capable.</p><p><strong>Emperor Drake Drakekonia (he/him):</strong> The Emperor of the Drakekonian Empire and a massive asshole, to put it lightly. He’s a powerful warrior but gained his throne through assassinations made to look like accidents until it was his turn to hold the title. He fanatically believes in the legends of the goddess and will do anything to bring a goddess under his control and use her power to extend his whims to the fabrics of reality. He uses scapegoating to manipulate his people to ignore their own oppression and focus on enemies of other natures, monster folk, and any who oppose him.  Emperor Drake carries a large lance.</p><h2>Marketopia</h2><p><strong>Christina Clombize (she/her):</strong> The rich daughter of a merchant family in Marketopia. She has internalized a lot of the ideas of her nation, believing that anyone can work their way up like her father did—with just the support of a noble family in another country and a little accidental death of a competitor. Still, she has a lot of expectations on her shoulders and holds a lot of power. Is it worth making a deal with the devil to work with her?  Or perhaps you could make the devil leave the markets behind and work towards equality. Her sword is a fancy rapier adorned with jewels that are probably from stolen land or extorted labor somewhere she never had to see.</p><p><strong>Raycoon Rapid (they/them, ze/zir):</strong> An inventor with a passion for creating gadgets of all kinds. Ze are very caring and make things because they want others to be happy. However, that doesn’t exactly vibe with Marketopia, and they are often on the run because they give things for free that out-com- pete “the market.” Raycoon is good at using materials ze find in the trash to build cool things and thus far has managed to escape from situations. This raccoon icon’s sword is always equipped with some new experimental tech.</p><h2>Unaligned</h2><p><strong>Meowlody (she/her, they/their, fae/faer):</strong> A cat folk and a professional thief. She’s always willing to sell to the highest bidder, it’s a cat-eat-cat world out there and she’s just trying to live after being burnt so many times.  Meowlody is a good person and won’t betray those she thinks are honestly good, but also will avoid going out of faer way to help others when first meeting them. Their sword can turn into a whip, and they’re very cunning with the applications of it. They have a lot of complicated feelings, but at the end of the day they want to help other people who suffered even if fae won’t admit it to herself.</p><p><strong>Nalia Sol (xe/xir, she/her):</strong> A were-monster. At night xe becomes a random monster; no rhyme or reason really that xe knows of. Nalia is a wanderer, looking for a home and community, having been cast out several times due to her nature. Nalia is a kind soul and friend to orphans wherever she goes, helping them out whenever possible. Nalia’s sword is like her “curse,” seemingly changing whenever she does.</p><h1>Names</h1><ul><li><p>Aceuther</p></li><li><p>Dyina</p></li><li><p>Lily</p></li><li><p>Vampurra</p></li><li><p>Amora</p></li><li><p>Haruka</p></li><li><p>Marxy</p></li><li><p>Wolfbetha</p></li><li><p>Bimbx</p></li><li><p>Hetono</p></li><li><p>Panxis</p></li><li><p>Zan</p></li><li><p>Darcy</p></li><li><p>Lezly</p></li><li><p>Sapphire</p></li></ul><h1>Custom Rules</h1><h2>Character Creation: Why Do You Care about Yuisa?</h2><p>When you create a character, decide why they care about Yuisa, why they defend it, and something important that it stands for.

The Princesses ruled over beautiful lands, but exiled anyone too different, too monstrous.

The Crown Prince of the Heteronormian Empire is to be married; as the Queertopian delegation, you’re there to advance the interests and values of your people. This adventure tends to fall on the “goofy” end of the tone spectrum, and can also be a cathartic power fantasy.</p><p><strong>Hook:</strong> After a chilly welcome, you discover that the Crown Prince is missing on his own wedding day, and the Hets are quick to blame you.</p><h1>Setup Questions</h1><p>GM: After your players select their playbooks, ask the following questions. If the listed playbooks aren’t in play, ask the question of someone else. Everyone should answer at least one question. If more than one named playbook is in play, they can each answer from their point of view or agree on an answer.</p><ul><li><p>Anyone: The wedding will take place on a particular planet within the Empire of Heteronormia.

What is it and how can you tell when it has struck?</p></li></ul><section id=\"secret-WiQYNoKgig55x6Eh\" class=\"secret\"><h1>GM Section: Contains Spoilers</h1><h2>What's Really Going On? One Possibility</h2><p>First of all, Heteronormia is ridiculous. It’s a bit scary, certainly, with its spacefaring navy and fearsome Battle Nuns, but it’s also a fairly over- the-top parody of real-world patriarchy. As written, it’s specifically a parody of Western patriarchy, with room to tailor the elements to focus on what you want to mock or rewrite for a different feel.</p><p>The Princess of Heteronormia is in love with the bride and has conspired with the Prince for him to be “abducted” by his boyfriend, a revolutionary. In other words, both Prince and Princess are likely to need the Queertopians’ help before day’s end. Of course, the Queertopians bring their own compli- cations—the Infamous or the Scoundrel may have wronged the bride or the Princess. The Chosen may have a nemesis on the scene. The Seeker may be a native Heteronormian and find their internal conflict becomes external.</p><p>The bride is not rigidly defined in this scenario so that her identity can be tailored to an ongoing game, or the Chosen can step into the role, or players can have input into who she is and why they have a stake in what’s going on. If the Chosen takes the role of the bride, the Princess will likely try to woo them during the chaos.</p><h1>Scene Ideas</h1><p><strong>An Unfriendly Greeting:</strong> The Queertopian vessel is directed to a somewhat remote landing site, where they’re greeted by a squad of Battle Nuns led by Captain Dolores. She informs them in an unenthusiastic tone that it’s her duty to greet them and escort them to the wedding venue. This scene is an opportunity to do at least two things:</p><p>Make it clear that Captain Dolores isn’t happy with the Queertopians’ presence. Privately, she’s fiercely devoted to Princess Jennifer of Heteronormia and she knows that the Princess has become confused about her sexuality of late. She is looking for a reason to confine the Queertopians and keep them away from the Princess.</p><p>Start to highlight the over-the-top elements of Heteronormia. What is the wedding venue? A sports arena? A brand-new resort built on paved-over slums or clear-cut endangered forest? A cathedral devoted to the solemn ritual of marriage? Build on the questions you asked the PCs.</p><p><strong>The Missing Groom:</strong> Shortly after arriving at the venue, the PCs overhear an alert on Dolores’s communicator. The Prince has been abducted! The report says that the investigators found glitter at the site of the struggle, cementing Dolores’s excuse to blame the Queertopians. The site might also resemble an attack by the legendary creature of the world’s wilderness. In truth, Prince Bradley’s boyfriend, Captain Cucumber, has faked a monster attack to cover the Prince’s escape. But Captain Cucumber, being such a great fan of Queertopia, has left some glitter behind. More on Cucumber later.</p><p>At this point, the PCs will likely want to prove their innocence and help investigate the Prince’s disappearance. Dolores doesn’t want them to leave, so they may have to sneak out or find another way to escape. If they stay and gather information from the assembled guests, Princess Jennifer will find them, expressing her pleasure that they came. Jennifer is suspiciously unconcerned about her brother’s disappearance, and is also the first friendly face the PCs meet in Heteronormia (unless they’ve already seduced Dolores, which is a distinct possibility).</p><p>Jennifer actually knows a great deal of what’s going on here, and the PCs may get a pretty good picture of things if they get her to confide in them. Of course, they may also get the impression that she’s the villain, arranging the abduction of her brother, or they may be separated when a concerned parent or Battle Nun intervenes. The Battle Nuns may also insist on searching the Queertopian ship (and intend to plant evidence). What Jennifer really wants, but is afraid to ask for, is to invoke the ancient tradition of Heteronormia: if the elder sibling can’t go through with a marriage, the younger sibling takes their place. Of course, the Hets never contemplated a same-sex wedding (or really thought of women as people at all). Jennifer and the bride are afraid of the Hets’ reaction if they invoke that tradition (or perhaps the bride is unwilling to invoke it unless she knows Jennifer will stand up to her parents). Certainly the King and Queen of Heteronormia won’t go along with it easily.</p><p>It’s perfectly alright if the PCs learn none of this at this stage and run off to investigate the Prince’s disappearance. They’ll have another chance later.</p><p><strong>On the Glitter Trail:</strong> The PCs will likely find themselves investigating the site of Prince Bradley’s disappearance at some point. The site has been doctored to make it look like an attack of the legendary beast, and there is indeed glitter—Queertopian glitter, which would only be available on the black market in Heternormia.</p><p>Now that the PCs have a plausible way of tracking, they can pursue the prince’s abductor to a secret hideout. Don’t make this too hard—crime scene investigation isn’t the focus of this game, and the PCs are badasses. The trail leads them to the lair of Captain Cucumber. Give it an over- the-top revolutionary/pirate aesthetic.</p><p>Captain Cucumber has no direct exposure to Queertopian culture—he learned about it through the queer-coded villains of Hetero media and caricatures—but he embraces it. He’s got the black market glitter and the rainbow cape and he is committed to the Revolution! He hopes that footage of his daring and romantic adventure with Prince Bradley will inspire others.</p><p>To that end, he has a variety of nets and nonlethal traps set up at the entrance to his lair, and he is prepared to confront his pursuers while Bradley hides in a closet and films the whole thing.</p><p>The first PC to enter should Defy Disaster or find themselves ensnared, and Captain Cucumber eagerly challenges any other pursuers to a duel.</p><p>When he realizes they are Queertopians, he’s simply thrilled to be dueling with them. He doesn’t want to hurt them; he wants to put on a good show for the camera. He’s going to be famous! At what he deems to be the right moment, he exclaims, “Would you truly get in the way of our True Love!?” and strikes a dramatic pose, revealing Bradley (if the PCs haven’t discovered him already).</p><p>The two lovebirds don’t have much of a plan. Bradley thinks that Jennifer will take his place in the wedding—he doesn’t know that she’s having cold feet about invoking her interpretation of Heteronormian tradition. After that… he might just slip away? He’s terrified of his parents and wants to flee to Queertopia, while Captain Cucumber wants to stay and fight to change things.</p><h1>Two Weddings and a Duel?</h1><p>The adventure can go many different ways from here. The Prince and Princess aren’t willing to confront their parents, though the PCs might be able to persuade them. They’ll probably need backup, though. Whether through trickery, persuasion, blackmail, or valor, the PCs need to help if these lovebirds are to have their happy ending. Pick an NPC to be the main obstacle to the wedding. You can let the PCs at them directly or pace things out more by putting other obstacles in their path. For instance:</p><ul><li><p>Captain Dolores truly cares about her childhood friend the Princess but hasn’t accepted her sexuality</p></li><li><p>The Queen and/or King definitely have swords and are prepared to use them</p></li><li><p>The Princess and Prince need emotional support if they’re going to stand up to their parents’ disapproval</p></li><li><p>Captain Cucumber wants to escalate things too far</p></li><li><p>Some of the NPC lovebirds become enamored with the PCs as well</p></li></ul><p>The PCs should also have opportunities to hash out their issues with them- selves or one another. At the end, we’ll see who has grown and whether the new generation of Heteronormians can be with the ones they love.</p><h1>Characters</h1><ul><li><p>Queen Martha Chadworth</p></li><li><p>King Branson Chadworth</p></li><li><p>Princess Jennifer Chadworth</p></li><li><p>Crown Prince Bradley Chadworth, the Groom</p></li><li><p>Captain Dolores, Battle Nun</p></li><li><p>Sister Frances, Battle Nun</p></li><li><p>Sister Maribel, Battle Nun</p></li><li><p>Captain Cucumber, Gay Revolutionary</p></li></ul><h1>Further Adventures</h1><p>Captain Cucumber wants to make good on the Revolution, and also wants to learn how to move past the stereotypes he’s been taught and become part of the community he’s never had.</p><p>Heteronormia’s system of patriarchy rejects any change of heart from the people in power, and seeks to depose them in favor of something even worse.

One Possibility</h2><p>The goddess Vanilla is actually a con artist (possibly known to the Trickster under a different guise). She pretends to bless the mud so the town can sell it as a beauty product, but she’s really after the pearls in the riverside’s mud oysters. When the villagers bring her enough of these, she’ll bail and move on to her next scheme. How does she convince them she’s a goddess? Pure force of personality? Does she have a “monstrous” nature that might appeal to a Spooky Witch? A magical item related to the Chosen’s Destiny or the Infamous’s past?</p><h1>Scene Ideas</h1><p><strong>Chaos on the Approach to Muddy River:</strong> The natural predators of the mud oysters are on a rampage because of villagers impinging on their territory to nab the oysters. This is a good opportunity to rescue some villagers who might be helpful or intriguing later on. For instance, a newly minted acolyte who is putting herself at extreme risk to wrestle an oyster away from a dangerous beast. Some down beats might lead to villagers getting emotional sway over the PCs or PCs taking Conditions. Several down beats might mean that Vanilla arrives and the beasts miraculously relent. Does she have some sway over them?</p><p><strong>Audience with the Goddess:</strong> This was once a temple of Repressia, but now curtains of vibrant color adorn the beige walls. “For too long, the people of this land have been forced to choose between extremes: the joyless Repressia and the flagrant Galladia. I have descended from my Cloud Garden to show the people a new way. A way of simple joys.”</p><p>Vanilla is in her element, with her worshippers all around her. Anyone attempting to use moves directly targeting her probably has to Defy Disaster to avoid being awed by her instead, or tossed out by her congregation.</p><p>It’s possible that a very effective group of PCs can expose Vanilla immediately. In that case, the adventure can revolve around protecting the town from the Repressian backlash (see Further Adventures, below). More likely, the PCs get some clues that all is not as it seems and discover that they need to get villagers on their side or find some hard evidence before confronting Vanilla.</p><p><strong>Champion of Repressia:</strong> If the action lags, the PCs are unsure how to continue, or a down beat gives you the chance to complicate matters, then Dame Chastity, Knight of Repressia, arrives to rescue the people of Muddy River from sin. Her arrival reminds the PCs that this situation isn’t just about Vanilla, but about the future of Muddy River.</p><p>Vanilla’s acolytes will shield her from Chastity, and a tense standoff ensues.

Each House believes the others are gaining power, meaning they must either strike first or trust in the others’ benevolence. After a long and horrendous war, trust is in short supply.  The scenario is complex enough that it lends itself best to a longer game of at least three sessions.</p><p>Early on, throw the characters into shared danger to help establish their friendships. Remind them of the competing demands placed on them by their House, as each continues to seek an advantage. Introduce peers, superiors, and the NPCs who represent the Houses’ interests. Make the Academy fantastic and dangerous in its own right. Perhaps it contains secrets of its own—and each House wants them for itself.</p><p>Mid-game, stir the old feuds between the Houses. Depending on your group, either let the PCs do their scheming and politicking to achieve peace or power, or introduce hints of a threat that wants the Houses fighting when they really ought to unite.</p><p>Finish with a dramatic event that brings influential figures from all three Houses to the Academy, such as a final test or a graduation ceremony.  Emphasize how tense things are between these leaders and how easily the peace could shatter. The PCs must navigate their obligations (a final test, a ceremony, a graduation prank) and prevent a war. Throw in a precipitating event—a murder or missing person, the first signs of a plague weapon from the Last War, a theft of a critical or incriminating secret—that puts the pressure on. Graduation provides a nice setting for a denouement and happy ending.</p><p>In a single-session game, you have little time to establish the trust between the PCs and the pressure on them from their House. Set the session at a final test: something dangerous and involved, with representatives of all Houses present. Use a super-obvious trigger for the potential war, like a murder or the theft of an important House relic. A single NPC should be behind the attempt to start the war, someone with connections to one or more PCs, but different priorities. The session revolves around preventing war, getting to the bottom of the crime, and maybe even passing the final test along the way.</p><p><strong>Out for Blood</strong>: The PCs’ professor is killed in the wee hours one night, and the murder method is something that several students would have access to. Worryingly, the professor had one of the few keys to the ritual chamber, treasure vault, or some other place holding great power, and now it’s missing! In truth, one of the PCs’ fellow students is the killer, but they acted in self-defense. The professor had recently been turned into a vampire by one of the other students, and was going to feed on the student, who turned the tables and killed them. Knowing the professor’s key shouldn’t be left lying around, that student took it with them when they fled the scene. Now the vampires are after them to get the key and the PCs are after them as they investigate the murder!</p><p><strong>Final Test:</strong> The PCs are dropped into the Labyrinth of Terror and must find their way out. If they go deeper into the Labyrinth, they may find the Jewel of Truth, which can root out the subterfuge. Along the way they may encounter spirits, monstrous residents of the Labyrinth, and other students attempting the test, perhaps separated from their groups (or with their own agendas). Meanwhile, the longer they spend in the depths, the more things grow out of hand amongst the House representatives.</p><h2>Characters</h2><h3>PROFESSORS</h3><ul><li><p>Marigold: An exile from Yellow House who betrayed the House’s interests to save lives on all sides.</p></li><li><p>Emerald: Last survivor of Green House, devastated in the war; guardian of the House’s secrets and surviving relic.</p></li></ul><h3>BLUE HOUSE</h3><ul><li><p>Teal: Aggressive beast-rider; will cover for anyone in Blue House who is accused.</p></li><li><p>Cobalt: A spellcaster conversant with the Unseen.</p></li><li><p>Sapphire: Shy, bookish, keeps notes on other students and doodles her favorite ships.</p></li></ul><h3>RED HOUSE</h3><ul><li><p>Vermillia: Noblewoman and author of scathing theatrical productions.</p></li><li><p>Russet: Armored warrior with giant two-handed blade.</p></li><li><p>Scarlet: Tactics and battle magic, unexpressive but solid friend.</p></li><li><p>Ruby: Psychic fighter, telepath, wants to make art and dance.</p></li></ul><h3>YELLOW HOUSE</h3><ul><li><p>Saffron: Heir to Yellow House, rich af, dabbles in chemical science.</p></li><li><p>Lemon: Smol, disaster lesbian; up for anything but with a vengeful streak.</p></li><li><p>Susan: Belligerent, stronk; frequently scraped and bruised, occasional black eye.</p></li></ul><h3>CONSPIRATORS</h3><ul><li><p>The Blood Queen: The Last War was a feast for vampire-kind, but feeding during peacetime threatens to reveal their presence.

Decide as a group:</p><ul><li><p>  When the PCs arrive at Castle Gayskull, are they operatives of the Princesses, Vanguard, neither, or a mix of allegiances?</p></li><li><p>  Why have the PCs come to this ancient, abandoned castle in wild and uncontrolled territory?</p></li></ul><p><strong>GM:</strong> Ask these questions of the named playbooks. If the listed playbooks aren’t in play, ask the question of someone else. Everyone should answer at least one question. If more than one named playbook is in play, they can each answer from their point of view or agree on an answer. Whenever answering a question, add a sensory detail about the castle or its perils that ties thematically to your answer.</p><ul><li><p>  Chosen, Seeker, or Spooky Witch: What ominous legend have you heard about Castle Gayskull, and how does the arrival of Vanguard fit into it?</p></li><li><p>  Scoundrel, Spooky Witch, or Trickster: How did the castle show you that it knew your heart, and why did this bring you closer to the other PCs?</p></li><li><p>  Beast, Devoted, or Infamous: The castle hints at a source of great power somewhere in the region. What do you most fear that Vanguard or the Princesses would do with that power?</p></li><li><p>  Chosen, Devoted, or Nature Witch: What do you learn from the castle that gives you hope that you and your friends can use the mysterious power for good, or keep it out of the wrong hands?</p></li><li><p>  Scoundrel, Seeker, or Trickster: What part of the castle did you mess with, or what did you take, that caused its defenses to chase you all out?</p></li><li><p>  Everyone: What about this experience brought you closer to the other characters?</p></li></ul><h1>GM Section: Contains Spoilers</h1><p>In a one-shot, you can focus the story on the race for the mysterious power, but the complexity of the relationships in this scenario means that it benefits from being spread over multiple sessions.</p><p>Highlight what’s toxic and what’s appealing about Vanguard and the Princesses. Show NPCs who don’t know how to proceed when both sides in this war want to exploit them. Show NPCs making bad choices for understandable reasons, and let the PCs show them alternatives or relieve the pressures they face.</p><p>This scenario provides ample opportunities for former friends and old flames to show up as adversaries. If the group includes PCs from the Vanguard or Princess forces, they might even go back to headquarters after leaving Castle Gayskull to gather information, which is a great opportunity to seed a complicated relationship with the leaders and henchpeople on both sides.</p><p>Decide with your group how realistic you want to be in your approach to problem-solving. You can try to organize people to stand against both Toxic Powers, or you can go for hidden magic artifacts and seduction. Both ways of playing are valid, just get on the same page about whether one of those options or something in-between is what excites your group!</p><h2>Adventure Ideas</h2><p><strong>Bow Down if You Want to Live:</strong> An independent village—perhaps the PCs’ village—faces some crisis, and one side or the other has offered to solve it in exchange for a steep price. Someone in the village asks the PCs to help before they have to bow before one of the Toxic Powers. The Toxic Power could even be creating the problem, not just exploiting it. Introduce a recurring adversary early on to act as the face of each Toxic Power—perhaps even a Princess herself.</p><p><strong>A Spark to Ignite the End:</strong> The PCs learn that the mysterious hidden power near Castle Gayskull must be the legendary Spark, a power that can restore the idyllic utopia of the ancient world. Obtaining the power of the Spark for herself is Vanguard’s true motive for her conquest, while the Princesses believe they can use its power to defeat Vanguard and anyone who would oppose them. If activated, though, the Spark works by resetting the world to an ancient state, threatening to unmake everything the PCs hold dear.</p><h2>Characters</h2><p><strong>Vanguard:</strong> The mysterious central figure throwing the old order of the world into chaos. Flesh her out only after you know what the PCs care about so that you can make her both appealing and villainous in ways that will speak to them. In broad strokes, she comes with great promises and gifts of fantastic technology to prove her good intentions. Her acceptance is given without regard to the Princesses’ rules; her only demand is obedience. And her orders seldom interfere with daily life, except when she wants to dig up an ancient temple or house a military force in town.</p><h3>VANGUARD’S ELITE</h3><ul><li><p> <strong>Petrafyre, Salamander General</strong>: Clad in armor of jagged obsidian and wreathed in flame, Petrafyre sees herself as Vanguard’s champion. She came with Vanguard from the stars, and knows more of her secrets than anyone else. Petra refuses to accept that anyone from this backwards world could be worthy of a place of honor by Vanguard’s side.</p></li><li><p> <strong>Spindrift, Lesbispider Operative/Surfer:</strong> Spindrift used to sneak into Princess Tempestria’s domain to catch sick waves, and the Storm Knights could never catch zir. The Princess herself blasted Spindrift with lightning and left zir for dead, and Vanguard found zir and nursed zir back to health. Ze’s now one of Vanguard’s most loyal and canny agents, a specialist in abduction and ambush. “Hang eight, dudettes!”</p></li></ul><h3>SPARKLAND PRINCESSES</h3><ul><li><p> <strong>Clandestina the Spy Princess:</strong> Rules a secret domain and works to root out dissent and difference within the Sparklands. Skilled at disguise and stealth, one can never know when she might be watching.</p></li><li><p> <strong>Sharkopella the Teeth Princess</strong>: Can transform into a fearsome sharkbeast to terrorize her foes and belt out her favorite songs. Anyone seeking to interrupt her transformation sequence would have to Defy Disaster on account of the sparkly ribbons of shark teeth that surround her during the change. The other Princesses really should object to her bestial form, but see no reason to be consistent with their prejudice.  It’s alright when she does it; she’s a Princess.</p></li><li><p> <strong>Tempestria the Storm Princess</strong>: Flies on wings of lightning and favors quick, decisive action. Unless you have an invitation, you almost always need to Defy Disaster to even speak with her.</p></li><li><p> <strong>Twilight the Goth Glitter Princess:</strong> Shrouded in an aura of sparkling darkness. When not writing gloomy poetry, she can be found in her laboratory, inventing new, darker colors and making magical glitter with a variety of effects.</p></li></ul><h3>INDEPENDENTS</h3><ul><li><p> <strong>Nana Batmaam:</strong> A wise old bat, literally. The wrinkled bat-woman is a dependable source of exposition and plot hooks, asking only for fresh fruit and good company in return.</p></li><li><p> <strong>Castle Gayskull:</strong> The Castle itself sometimes behaves as if it has personality and intent. Corridors and traps shift from place to place, uncovering secrets long-buried. It might be random, but Castle Gayskull is a place where seemingly impossible coincidences become commonplace.                                     </p></li></ul>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":700000,"name":"Sparkle Heart Magic Force Go!","type":"text","_id":"awa3RQyAFdq39O6v","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Pitch: It’s been years since the Mystical Guardians of the Sparkle Heart received their call to arms.

Years later, they’re going to have to remember their power and their friendship to confront a new threat.</p><p>Hook: Each of the PCs has their own encounter with a magical threat, years after their last call to arms. This time, their opponents aren’t mindless demons, they’re people. You can’t just “Glitter Blade Annihilation Attack” people, can you? Can you even rekindle that magic at all after so long apart?</p><h1>Setup Questions</h1><p>As a group, answer the following questions to develop your shared world: What was most terrifying about the Eidolons you encountered years ago?  Detached parts stay alive, beauty entrances mundane people, reflections of yourselves, right behind you when you least expect it, invisible to mundane people, predatory cunning</p><ul><li><p>When you were attacked recently, what did each of the attackers have in common?</p></li></ul><p><em>They knew everything about our time at school, they carried our old swords, they wore Eidolon masks, they seemed familiar but unplaceable, they mirrored our movements, they moved like our closest comrades</em></p><ul><li><p>You left a conspicuous glittering heart symbol at the site of the gate, but everyone else acts as if it’s always been there.

Every PC has a separate <strong>Bond</strong> track, which starts at 0 <strong>Bond</strong> after the time they spent apart. Bond tracks reset to 0 each session until the PCs rebuild their trust.</p><p> Track <strong>Bond</strong> in a central place accessible to all players. Whenever a PC spends a String on another PC in a way that helps them, each PC involved marks 1 <strong>Bond</strong>. This might mean Influencing with a String to give them +1 to a roll or to tempt them to do some self-care. It might mean spending a String for the +3 when giving Emotional Support. It’s the recipient’s call whether using a String counts as helpful.</p><h2>Rebuilding Trust</h2><p>If a PC has <strong>Trust</strong>, <strong>Bond</strong> resets to their <strong>Trust</strong> value instead of 0 at the start of each session. You can ignore this rule if playing a single-session game.</p><ul><li><p>  A character’s <strong>Trust</strong> can increase as a result of a String Advance or by accumulating <strong>Bond</strong>, and can decrease whenever the player chooses.</p></li><li><p>  When a PC earns a String Advance by accumulating four Strings on another PC, resolve it as normal. In addition, if the PC shares the insight they gain about the other person in an empathetic way, that person gains a point of Trust.</p></li><li><p>  Additionally, each PC can increase Trust by 1 once per session if their <strong>Bond</strong> is at least 4 greater than their Trust. So a PC with 0 Trust can increase it if they’re at 4 <strong>Bond</strong>.</p></li></ul><h1> Custom Moves</h1><h2> OBLITERATE EIDOLON</h2><p> An Eidolon can be temporarily banished by inflicting Conditions, but only the combined power of the Mystical Guardians can bring a lasting end to these creatures.</p><p>   When you confront an Eidolon as a team, each PC says the name of their signature magic attack. Then, the PC with the lowest Bond rolls. If tied, whoever feels least integrated into the team rolls. Roll <strong>+Bond</strong> and subtract the number of unmarked Conditions the Eidolon has:</p><ul><li><p>  10+: Working in harmony, you obliterate the Eidolon and the GM will tell you what clue or useful object it leaves behind.</p></li><li><p>  7–9: A disagreement, jealousy, or other disruption means you are almost devoured before the magic obliterates the Eidolon at the last possible moment. Describe it.</p></li><li><p>  6-: The GM is encouraged to make a move that turns your magic against you.</p></li></ul><h1>Custom Relationships</h1><p>Select playbooks and create characters as usual, except use the following relationship prompts. Then assign each other zero, one, or two Strings as normal.</p><ul><li><p>Beast: Who went exploring with you the most back then? Who will be most surprised by how you’ve changed?</p></li><li><p>Chosen: What relationship from back then did you break off to pursue your Destiny? Who is going to be most disappointed in you?</p></li><li><p>Devoted: You managed to stay in close touch with one comrade; who? You wish you’d paid more attention to one of your comrades back then; who?</p></li><li><p>Infamous: Who was with you during your lowest moment back then?  Who thinks this new menace must be your fault somehow?</p></li><li><p>Nature Witch: If you had listened to one of your friends, you would have started experimenting in life a lot sooner; who? You try to emulate your memory of one of your friends from back then; who?</p></li><li><p>Scoundrel: Back then, you kissed someone you shouldn’t have. Who was most upset? Which of the others did you reach out to at a low moment, shortly before the recent attacks?</p></li><li><p>Seeker: Who tried the hardest to get you to grow past your Commandments back then? Which Commandment do you wish you had violated back then? With whom?</p></li><li><p>Spooky Witch: Who helped cover for you when you kept a tiny Eidolon pet? Who always seems interested in your theories about magic, even after years apart?  Trickster: For years, you’ve regretted not sharing a secret with one of your comrades; who, and why do you hesitate now that you have the chance? Who was your greatest confidante back then, and why have you tried to distance yourself from them?</p></li></ul><p>Questions for the Players</p><p><strong>GM:</strong> After your players select their playbooks, ask the following questions in order. If the listed playbook isn’t in play, ask the question of someone else.</p><p><strong>Players</strong>: When answering, describe how your PC’s presentation has changed.</p><ul><li><p>  Devoted: You reached out to the others after you were attacked, to call for this reunion. What time and place did you pick? Does it have sentimental significance?</p></li><li><p>  Spooky Witch: Your adversary didn’t attack immediately. When they extended their hand, why did you reject them?</p></li><li><p>  Trickster: Who or what taught the Mystical Guardians to use your powers? Why do you distrust them?</p></li><li><p>  Seeker: Which of your beliefs have helped you cope with the trauma of being forced into battle back then, if any?</p></li><li><p>  Beast: Why did you leave school before graduating?</p></li><li><p>  Infamous: What about your adversary was eerily reminiscent of your past misdeeds?</p></li><li><p>  Chosen: Why are your other obligations incompatible with becoming a Mystical Guardian again?</p></li><li><p>  Scoundrel: What’s the most foolish thing you’ve done while chasing the thrill you felt back then, and why does it still haunt you?</p></li><li><p>  Nature Witch: Why do you feel like a brand-new person compared to back then?</p></li></ul><section id=\"secret-nfBWLSyNExdeqJVm\" class=\"secret\"><h1>GM Section: Contains Spoilers</h1><p>This scenario forces together a group of PCs who used to be close, but have drifted apart. There may be obvious explanations for why they parted ways, or it might be something to discover during play.</p><p>Back then, the Guardians were focused on defeating the Eidolons, finding the portal that let them enter the world, and sealing them out. They didn’t necessarily learn the truth about what lay on the other side of the portal or the nature of the Sparkle Heart; these are mysteries to explore during play.</p><p>Whatever the truth is, start off by exploring the PCs’ relationships. Throw the characters into shared danger and see how well they’re able to work together despite their time apart. On down beats, emphasize how an opponent slips through a gap in their team’s defenses, or how a new problem surprises them because they’re distracted or not working as a team.</p><p>Introduce complications arising from the ways they’ve changed, as well.  Early on, introduce key NPCs who will help drive the PCs’ emotional conflict, and put a face on their adversary to be a recurring villain.  It’s also a good idea to have some temptations to offer to lure the PCs to the side of their adversary, to try to break their unity and loyalty, especially early on when it is most shaky.</p><p>The adversary is connected somehow to the Eidolons and might even use them as weapons and minions. Remember that conflict in Thirsty Sword Lesbians is character-focused, and make sure that the main opponents are people. If the Eidolons really aren’t intelligent, then they won’t be as satisfying to center in a conflict, so use them as tools of the true adversary or as threats that might require PCs to Defy Disaster to protect one another or NPCs.</p><p>This scenario includes two timer mechanisms if you’re playing a campaign of multiple sessions: the progress of the PCs’ Trust and the countdown to the adversary’s plan coming to fruition. The countdown may force the PCs to seek out their most dangerous foes before they’re ready, or risk catastrophe.</p><p>Ultimately, the PCs should learn enough about their adversary that they can make a call about whether they’re going to try to obliterate them like all those Eidolons back then or connect with them as people.</p><p>You have a decision to make if the PCs try to use Obliterate Eidolon on their new adversaries. What’s the moral of the story? Have their adversaries shown a capacity to grow? Are they lashing out in pain? Then a punitive, destructive response might not be productive. It might fuel their pain and strengthen their agenda. It might let them turn that destructive power against the PCs and destroy something they care about or make them Stagger.</p><p>At the other end of the spectrum, the adversary might be irredeemable.  Maybe they were hurt, but it doesn’t excuse their escalation, and they won’t accept any remedy other than total, final victory. Or maybe their agenda was always to take and take from the human world. In these cases, standing in unity to oppose them can be a positive climactic moment. You can use an up beat on Obliterate Eidolon to heighten this heroic moment and perhaps leave a clue of any plot elements not discovered during play.  A mixed beat might mean that it only takes effect after a significant delay, and leads to a few more tense story beats. A down beat shouldn’t end the climactic battle; make the PCs take Conditions or Stagger as the adversary pushes back with their own power, then continue as with the mixed beat.  If the PCs can keep up the pressure, they’ll win, but they’re up against something more powerful than ever before.</p><h2>Potential Adversaries</h2><p>You can use either of these options or both at once:</p><p>The Lost was once the final member of the team, but has been almost entirely erased from this timeline. They have Bond and Trust scores of –1, but don’t reveal this until the PCs try to use Bond in their presence and discover that their connection to the Sparkle Heart is unbalanced when the Lost is near. (The PC with the lowest Bond still makes the roll, but the modifier is the Lost’s Bond of –1 instead of theirs.)</p><ul><li><p>  Did they sacrifice themself back then?</p></li><li><p>  Were they left behind?</p></li><li><p>  Did they betray the team?</p></li><li><p>  Are they working with the Eidolons or for their own purposes?</p></li></ul><p>The Idols are the latest evolution of the Eidolons, shaped by the battles back then and made in the image of the Mystical Guardians. They gain power from lesser Eidolons by devouring them (perhaps as part of the bonus GM move you make when they suffer Conditions). They can only imagine the power they would obtain by devouring their counterparts, the Guardians.</p><ul><li><p>  Were the Eidolons always intelligent and it’s only recognized now that they’re human-shaped?</p></li><li><p>  What do they feel towards their counterparts? Fascination? Hatred?</p></li><li><p>  Can they learn to work as a team, the way the Guardians did back then?</p></li></ul><h2>Potential Countdown</h2><p>What is the adversary after and how are they going to get it? Use a short countdown of five or so steps and control the pace of the countdown by deciding how often you’re going to use GM moves to progress it instead of doing something in the moment. For a sense of inevitability, simply have it advance on its own at the beginning of each session.</p><h3>COUNTDOWN</h3><p><strong>CONSUME WHAT MAKES PEOPLE SPECIAL</strong></p><p><strong>5</strong> - Everyone except the PCs chooses to wear grey clothing from now on. If a PC marks Hopeless, their clothes turn grey.</p><p><strong>4 -</strong> becomes difficult to get the attention of NPCs. If a PC is Hopeless, It they can no longer shout or do the equivalent in other modes of communication.</p><p><strong>3 -</strong> Silence falls as NPCs stop conversing for pleasure and stop playing music.</p><p><strong>2 -</strong> The  PCs sense distress from the Sparkle Heart; the adversary is near and is trying to reopen the gate.</p><p><strong>1 -</strong> The adversary gets their claws into the Sparkle Heart. One more down beat, and it will become the Heart of Stone.</p><h2>Adventure Ideas</h2><h3>The Second Gate</h3><p>The PCs detect an old-style Eidolon preying on people near one of the potential gate locations from the setup questions (which are, incidentally, all excellent places for a sword fight). The victims might be comatose, changed, or missing, but the mundane characters around them are oddly oblivious to the change. One of the PCs’ adversaries is gathering power to open a new gate and unleash a new wave of Eidolons.</p><p>Will the PCs prioritize restoring what has been taken from the victims, or preventing a new wave of attack? Will the adversary learn an important secret about how the Guardians sealed the first gate?</p><h3>Sleeper Agent</h3><p>One of the PCs’ mundane friends is subverted by the adversary and reveals the PCs’ secret rivalries and hurt feelings. The adversary hatches a plot to drive a wedge between the PCs and ambush some of them while they’re not together to call upon the Sparkle Heart. They might even believe that they can recruit one of the Guardians to their side. What can they offer that the other PCs can’t?Pitch: It’s been years since the Mystical Guardians of the Sparkle Heart received their call to arms.

As a transfeminine person, I’m most comfortable talking from my own experience, but I’ve also heard from people with other experiences— even beyond queer identities—about how the feelings embodied in the playbooks speak to them, as well.</p><p>To focus on telling trans stories, there’s no single playbook that is “the trans playbook.” We’re all varied human beings who experience life in different ways. Instead, there are elements of every playbook that have the potential to speak to the experiences of some subset of trans people. And, of course, you can play trans people whose most significant emotional struggles, the ones represented by their playbook, have nothing to do with their transness.</p><p><strong>The Beast</strong></p><p>The Beast is very explicitly about the pressure to assimilate, to suppress your self-expression in favor of a dominant norm. All sorts of marginalized people experience this, and for trans people it can mean either remaining closeted or expressing yourself according to cis narratives. It’s easier to “pass” if you don’t stand out in any way. It’s easier to get respect from cis people as a flat-chested trans woman if you wear breast forms. It’s easier to get respect if you change your voice—but what if you love your voice?</p><p>The Beast playbook celebrates your uniqueness and shows the high cost of suppressing your true self in order to appease a toxic society. Not everyone can be out safely in real life, of course, and not everyone has the option to pass or mask or blend. For some, though, the Beast’s story will be empowering, cathartic, or familiar.</p><p><strong>The Nature Witch</strong></p><p>The Nature Witch feels very new to interacting with other people, hungry for new experiences. This touches on the feeling of discovering who you are as an adult and trying to make up for lost time or navigate the new scripts that people are applying to you. The playbook is anchored by a connection to their environment—animals don’t treat them any differently now than before, plants haven’t changed how they work just because the Nature Witch has a new understanding of their gender, and for the Techno Witch variant, their code still runs just like before. It’s just people that relate to them differently—in some good ways and some bad ways.</p><p><strong>The Seeker</strong></p><p>The Seeker represents a different kind of newness, where you’ve figured out that the things you’ve internalized about how to behave aren’t right, but they still hold sway. Sometimes the personal experience of rejecting the identities and behaviors assigned to you by a toxic authority translates into a broader rethinking of values. You can earn Tradition by following your Commandments, but Tradition isn’t good for much—just appeasing the Authority for a time. Rejecting those Commandments to write your own Convictions is more powerful and more fun!</p><p><strong>The Trickster</strong></p><p>The Trickster is afraid that people won’t like them anymore if they reveal who they truly are. This is hardly an experience unique to trans people, but it’s extremely common in media and real life for trans people to be rejected or harmed when a cis person learns of our transness. It can be scary to open up, but it also hurts to keep it in. The Trickster’s arc usually sees them finding trustworthy people who will love them for who they really are.</p><p><strong>The Infamous</strong></p><p>The Infamous is someone who has firmly rejected their past, yet is still haunted by it and is seen as a villain when they are not. Some trans people have guilt around pre-transition behaviors, often behaviors demanded for their assigned gender, and many trans people are simply villainized unfairly. The Infamous can explore either or both of these feelings of guilt and villainization, with enough of a fictional narrative remove to make it fun. (And characters of any playbook could touch on the villainization themes, especially the Beast and Spooky Witch).</p><p><strong>The Spooky Witch</strong></p><p>Speaking of the Spooky Witch, their conflict with society comes from their interest in acknowledging and socializing with monsters and with the Unseen—those society villainizes or doesn’t want to perceive at all. They might be analogous to anyone who could enjoy better treatment from society if they abandoned their friends (perhaps because they “pass” as cis more than their friends or enjoy other privileges).</p><p><strong>The Chosen</strong></p><p>The Chosen could tell a story about someone who isn’t yet out as trans, who is elevated but only if they pursue their socially enforced Destiny in accordance with their assigned gender.</p><p><strong>The Devoted &amp; The Scoundrel</strong></p><p>And the Devoted and Scoundrel also touch on themes that could easily be given a trans flavor. The Devoted struggles to do self-care—maybe because they’re depressed and have low self-esteem due to the way their society treats trans people. The Scoundrel has trouble connecting—maybe because they haven’t figured out something fundamental about themself, such as their gender (or sexual orientation, for that matter).</p><p>Again, all trans people are different and all of the playbooks are open to a variety of interpretations. You’re not wrong if you resonated with a playbook for a different reason. They exist to help you tell your stories.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.J5J3mKNjY8zKaaZ8"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pbta","systemVersion":"0.7.0","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1674530895833,"modifiedTime":1674697158270,"lastModifiedBy":"ES3EZSvZgn8ubYUn"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"ES3EZSvZgn8ubYUn":3},"_id":"ms0JFabUSHydgYzW"}
